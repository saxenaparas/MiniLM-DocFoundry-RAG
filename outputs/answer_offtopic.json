Afterfilter Parts List18 High Efficiency Cyclone Dust Collector    C SeriesFigure 13. Wiring Diagram 19 High Efficiency Cyclone Dust Collector    C Series5. Operation 5.1 Start-Up Inspect the installation area and make certain no tools, parts, etc. have been left anywhere on or inside the unit. Check the fan discharge to make certain it is free from all debris. Start fan motor and check for proper rotation. A rotation arrow is located on the fan housing. If the fan is rotating in the opposite direction, disconnect the power to the motor starter, interchange any two wires on the output side of the starter (three-phase systems only), engage starter disconnect, then start fan and recheck rotation. Before each start-up, verify that hopper slide gates are closed. DUST-HOG High Efficiency Cyclone Dust Collector drum lids with gasketing and drums must be firmly in place and tight fitting. Ductwork slide gates must be open. Check exhaust for any obstruction. To operate the cyclone dust collector, simply turn on the blower. NOTE:  Running fan in incorrect rotation for an extended period of time will cause fan motor damage and reduce life of fan motor. Adjust airflow with volume control damper(s) (not supplied by Parker) on individual ductwork drops. 5.2 Check List Always verify that any hopper slide gates are closed and that the doors, drum lids and gaskets are in place. The material being collected will not separate from the airstream if any leakage occurs around the base or drum. Failure to adhere to these instructions may also cause the motor to overload. Verify that exhaust air remains visibly clean. If an emission develops, examine drums, drum lids, etc. for possible leaks.The blower compartment bolt-on panel must be installed before operating the dust collector.! CAUTION 6. Service Shut off the unit. Disconnect and lockout all electrical power to the dust collector prior to performing service work.! CAUTION BEFORE SERVICING, NOTE THE FOLLOWING: 1. Disconnect electrical power to the unit and control panel. 2. Wear appropriate protective clothing when servicing the dust collector. 3. Collected dust may be hazardous. Consult proper authorities for handling and disposal. 4. Collected dust may be a potential fire hazard. DO NOT perform grinding or operations involving open flames unless fire protection measures are in place. Refer to Section 1 for additional precautions. 5. Disposal of collected dust must be according to state and local environmental regulations.20 High Efficiency Cyclone Dust Collector    C Series6.1 Dust Removal Turn off the dust collector and empty the dust storage drum/container as necessary to prevent dust from accumulating. Empty the dust storage drum or hopper when two-thirds full. If dust levels in storage containers are allowed to accumulate to a high level, dust may be drawn through the unit and discharged out the exhaust. NOTE:  Do not allow the drum or hopper to overfill. This can cause poor collector performance and require extensive cleanup if the dust overflows when the collecting device is removed. 6.2  Servicing the Direct Drive Motor and Fan (C190-C3000) ! WARNING All electrical work should be done by a qualified electrician in accordance with local electrical codes. Disconnect electrical power before installing or servicing any electrical component. Periodically inspect the fan blades to ensure proper fan life. Clean the fan to remove any deposited material if required. For motor maintenance, follow the manufacturer’s directions.",
