  "answer": "must be separately grounded. 6. Do not manually override or electrically bypass any protective device. 7. If the Cyclone is equipped with a maintenance panel or access door incorporating a Protective Interlocking Limit Switch (PLS), the PLS must be interlocked with all electrical controls. This is to prevent all motors or powered devices associated with the unit from being energized if any protective cover, guard, grate or maintenance panel is open or removed. Never attempt to manually override or electrically bypass a safety device. The interlock function of the PLS must be tested and logged daily by supervisory personnel. 8. It is the owner’s and the employer’s responsibility to adequately train the employee-operator in the proper and safe use of the equipment. Written safety programs and formal instruction are essential. All new employees must be made aware of company policies and operating rules, especially the established safety and health procedures. Refresher training of experienced employees in the potential hazards of the job is important. Up-to-date training records must be maintained at the job site. 9. Special attention must be devoted to outside contractors engaged to enter and perform work on equipment or in the workplace. Special care must be exercised to insure all such personnel are fully informed of the potential hazards and follow plant rules – with special emphasis on explosion proof electrical tools and cutting or welding in unsafe environments. 10. Keep the workplace cleaned up and free of dirt and dust at all times. Do not attempt to work on slippery or unsafe ladders or work platforms when maintenance or repair work is being performed on the Cyclone. 11. Do not climb on ladders or work on platforms unless maximum load rating is posted. Do not exceed maximum load ratings when installing or servicing the Cyclone. 12. Never allow any kind of metal or other foreign objects to enter a Cyclone while in operation, unless the system is specifically designed as a wire or metal reclaim system. 13. The Kice Cyclone has no moving parts. Therefore, access into the machine is not restricted. However, in some installations, there is a machine discharging material from the Cyclone. The accessory machinery feeding and discharging the material may be dangerous to personnel working on or around the Cyclone. 14. Operate safely at all times. Use personal protective equipment when and where appropriate, such as hard hats, helmets, gloves, earplugs, and eye protection devices. Keep personal protective equipment in good repair and convenient to the operator. 15. When carrying out cleaning, service or maintenance activities a dust mask should be worn. 16. The operator of the cyclone must ensure that adequate lightning conditions are provided at the set-up location. 17. It is ultimately the operator’s responsibility to implement the above listed precautions and insure proper equipment use, maintenance and lubrication. Keep these instructions and list of warnings with your machine at all times. 18. There is a separate ignition source analysis for the Cyclone, where all dangers concerning explosion protection are considered.

Never stand under a lifted load or place any part of your body under a lifted load. Do not move the load over any part of another person's body. When handling the equipment, keep in mind that the lifting capacity of the lifting device must always be greater than the weight of the load. Inspect tying and lifting devices before use and replace defective parts with new ones. Do not use damaged or incomplete lashings. Lashing chains or ropes or straps must not be twisted, knotted or kinked when lifting. Never attempt to repair defective parts in an unprofessional manner. Always use personal protective equipment such as work boots when handling the equipment with reinforced tip, protective gloves and protective helmets 12CONNECTION TO THE ELECTRICAL NETWORKIt only applies if the cyclone accessories include electrical appliances, e.g. fan, rotary feeder, or cyclone body heating. User instructions will be supplied separately for these components. Before connecting to the mains supply, check that the mains supply has the correct parameters to ensure the rotary feeder (if supplied) has the correct power. Check that the mains voltage and frequency corresponds to the information on the electric motor's label. Ensure that the supply cable is not live. Wiring should be done according to the instructions for the electric motor and the control unit, see MANUFACTURER AND SUBCONTRACTOR DOCUMENTATION. The wiring diagram for the electric motor is also shown in the motor terminal cover. The wiring must comply with the applicable standards in the country of the operator and varies individually according to the system in which the filter unit is integrated. The unit must in any case be earthed and all parts conductively connected. The unit shall be prevented from unexpected start-up according to the applicable national standards of the country of operation and shall be equipped with a lockable shutdown device.

In analysing the numerous refere nces which are available, the reader finds great difficulty in isolating basic facts on which he can begin to build his understanding. The first rule which is generally accepted is the simple empirically proved fact that the end product, which can be term ed as ‘collecting efficiency’, is related to energy expended. In more basic terms we set out the rough yardstick ‘collecting efficiency’ increases as the ‘water gauge’ goes up. There are exceptions to this rule as in the case of the multi -cellular cyclon e, which uses a number of small cyclonets housed within a plenum chamber. The rule of thumb ‘CE is proportional to WG” is modified with formula too complicated and bulky to discuss in this text; our comment is confined to broad generalizations in the hope  that reader may pass on to informative references, which deal with the subject in detail. With all cyclone work it must be appreciated that to separate the particles from the airstream tangential entry and airspeed are necessary to create a vortex which does the spiralling action of downward and upward air movement; this is in essence all that the fabricated steel shell and inner thimble induces. The density of the particle will determine together with its shape and size what can be done with it once it enters the cyclone. It is impossible to supply momentum to an object if the object is not capable of receiving it. To explain this more fully let us consider two balls each measuring two inches diameter. The first ball can be a balloon; this is a plastic  skin containing air which pressurizes to maintain spherical shape. The second can be more dense, say something like a cricket ball. Now we imagine the human arm throwing object 1 (the balloon), the thrower expends energy, say 200 ft and the ball travels no more than 5ft. In the case of object 2 (the cricket ball), the same amount of energy is expended and the ball travels 100 yards. This simply means certain physical characteristics are required before one can create momentum from air speed and the tang ential entry on the cyclone in order that the dust may be centrifuged out. After appreciating that density plays a part in the behaviour of the particle the next consideration is that of shape. The physical contours of the particle are of the utmost impo rtance, they determine the sail cloth effect that resists natural settling in free air. Particles are never truly spherical; all shapes are involved, varying between two uniformed extremes, i.e., the ball bearing and the postage stamp, which has a very hi gh sail effect with resultant slow settling rate. The problems involved in calculating settling rates are relatively easy if the particle is of uniformed shape. In considering any dust sample it inevitably transpires that the shapes are anything but unif ormed, this makes calculation labourious and in some cases well nigh impossible. At this stage special equipment is employed to aid analysis. This equipment consists of a long thin transparent tube coupled at the base with an air connection and required auxillaries to meter 5 airflow. The dust sample is placed in the tube and air is introduced to create a fluidizing action; the performance of the particles are noted, some will fall against the airflow, others will be blown up the tube to be captured in a c ontainer interconnected  with the equipment. Numerous tests are carried out at varying up -draft velocities and the physical performance of the dust recorded. This method known as elutriation or terminal velocity analysis automatically",
