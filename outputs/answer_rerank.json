This can cause poor collector performance and require extensive cleanup if the dust overflows when the collecting device is removed. 6.2 Servicing the Direct Drive Motor and Fan (C190-C3000) ! WARNING All electrical work should be done by a qualified electrician in accordance with local electrical codes. Disconnect electrical power before installing or servicing any electrical component. Periodically inspect the fan blades to ensure proper fan life. Clean the fan to remove any deposited material if required. For motor maintenance, follow the manufacturer’s directions. If your motor requires servicing under the motor manufacturer’s warranty, contact an authorized service center. Motors are greased at the factory and do not need lubrication at time of installation. However, regreasing may be necessary after 1,000 hours of use. As a guideline, grease the motor every 3,600 hours with high grade ball and roller bearing grease. Recommended greases are Shell Dolium R or Chevron SRI#2.21 High Efficiency Cyclone Dust Collector    C SeriesAll electrical work should be done by a qualified electrician in accordance with local electrical codes. Disconnect electrical power before installing or servicing any electrical component.! WARNING For motor maintenance, follow the manufacturer’s directions. If your motor requires servicing under the motor manufacturer’s warranty, contact an authorized service center. Motors are greased at the factory and do not need lubrication at time of installation. However, regreasing may be necessary after 1,000 hours of use. As a guideline, grease the motor every 3,600 hours with high grade ball and roller bearing grease. Recommended greases are Shell Dolium R or Chevron SRI#2. All bearings used are sealed, have been lubricated at the factory and do not need lubrication at the time of installation. Subsequent lubrication will be required and the motor and bearing manufacturer’s recommendations should be followed. Use the following instructions as guidelines. The fan bearings should be relubricated at six week intervals when utilized for eight-hour workday operations. The fan bearings should be relubricated more frequently if operation time is longer than eight hours per day. When lubricating, be sure to grease both bearings and use high grade medium weight ball bearing grease. It is also recommended that you consult your lubricant supplier regarding proper greases for both the motor and fan bearings. Proper grease should be based on hours of usage and environmental conditions. If any bearing operates roughly, the unit should be shut down and the bearing replaced immediately.6.3 Servicing the Belt Driven Fan and Motor (C3600-C4400)22 High Efficiency Cyclone Dust Collector    C Series6.4  Belt Adjustment and Replacement The belts on your new unit have been properly adjusted at the factory. However, before operating, it is suggested that belts be checked and re-adjusted if necessary. Recheck belts several times in the first days of operation and at least twice a month for the following six months. Thereafter, belts should be checked at each greasing. The drive used on this unit is equipped with banded belts and matching sheaves which transmit much higher horsepower per belt than older type belts. Because much higher tension is required, it is advisable that the tension be checked with a tester or springs scale (see Figure 14). To adjust belts, loosen bolts on motor mounting plate, adjust tension screws on adjustment bracket in or out (depending on desired adjustment), then re-tighten bolts on motor mounting plate. Do not over tighten. Too much or too little tension will damage the drive belts and bearings. Check the tension frequently to be sure the deflection is at the value determined. To replace worn belts, loosen bolts on motor mounting plate and remove tension screws so the old belts can be removed from the sheaves. Remove the tension bracket and the bolts from the upper bearing bracket. Rotate the bracket 90° and remove old belt. Put new belt on and reverse the disassembly order to re-assemble. Replacement belts should be ordered and installed in complete matched sets or one banded belt. Include old belt number(s) when reordering. General Rules of Tensioning 1. Ideal tension is the lowest tension at which the belt will not slip under peak conditions. 2. Check tension frequently during the first 24-48 hours of operation. 3. Over-tensioning shortens belt and bearing life. 4. Keep belts free from foreign material which may cause slippage. 5. Make V-belt inspections on a regular basis. Re-tension when slipping. Never apply belt dressing as this will damage the belt and cause early failure.Model Nominal Belt Span Deflection Force - lbs Deflection New Belt Used Belt C3620 21 3/8 9.1 7.1 11/32 C3625 21 3/8 13.2 8.8 11/32 C2630 21 3/8 13.2 8.8 11/32 C4440 21 3/8 20.1 13.7 11/32 C4450 21 3/8 20.1 13.7 11/3223 High Efficiency Cyclone Dust Collector    C Series EXAMPLE Figure 14. Belt Adjustment Diagram 6.5 Afterfilters The afterfilter bags on the Cyclone Dust Collector are semi-permanent and will give you long, efficient service if you perform routine maintenance. After each day’s operation, shake the filter bag(s) vigorously to remove the clinging material. If the afterfilter bag has a zipper-closed bottom, always empty the bag after shaking. For C-Series afterfilters, open slide gates before shaking bags so dust can fall into drums. Close slide gates after cleaning is completed. Care should be taken to prevent tearing or puncturing the filter fabric.

Upon receipt of the claim, Parker IGFG will review and determine if the parts replaced need to be returned for quality evaluation and root cause investigation. If a part is required to be returned, Parker IGFG will issue a Return Material Authorization (RMA) to Return via email. Parts should be returned to Parker IGFG, freight collect, within 45 days accompanied by the RMA packing slip placed on the package. If the repaired part does not need to be returned you will be advised to field scrap it and the claim will be processed. Proof of the defect (written description and pictures of the parts units in question) is required. NOTE: ANY PART NOT RETURNED WITHIN THE REQUIRED 45 DAYS WILL NOT BE REIMBURSED ON THE CLAIM. On claims that require repaired parts return, the claim will be processed after the part has been evaluated by the Parker IGFG Quality Department for verification of failure mode. The claims will be paid in the form of a credit to the customer’s account.
