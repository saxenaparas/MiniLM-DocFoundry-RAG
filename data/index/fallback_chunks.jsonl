The separator removes abrasives from the flushing liquid to extend the life of the mechanical seal. This arrangement is maintenance free. A differential pressure of 30 psig or greater across the pump is required for suitable separator operation. Typical Piping Arrangement Principle of Operation Liquid piped from the pump discharge enters the separator feed connection and is rotated inside the cone shaped bore at a velocity dependant on the pressure differential. The particles in the liquid, being of greater density than the liquid remain close to the tapered wall of the cone and course downward to the discharge outlet at the bottom of the separator. From there they are Piped with a small amount of liquid to the suction flange. The clean liquid rises up through the outlet at the top of the separator and is then piped to the gland plate for flushing of the seal. Note: No maintenance is required, however the sight flow indicator should be checked periodically for fluid flow.® S.A.

Its main purpose is to protect the working environment and maintain air quality by separating and trapping impurities that could otherwise be inhaled by workers or contaminate production processes. It can also help extend the life of other machinery and equipment by reducing the amount of dust and dirt that can settle and accumulate on their components. IMPROPER USE OF EQUIPMENTCyclone separators shall not be used for purposes or under conditions other than those specified above. Furthermore, it is forbidden to operate them with components other than those with which they were supplied. Cyclone separators must not be operated in a different power range than that specified in this manual. Improper use of the units includes installation and maintenance by untrained or unauthorized persons, operation with a malfunction or defect, and operation with dismantled or modified enclosures. If it is discovered that the cyclone separator has been installed or serviced by an untrained or unauthorized person, or has been used for purposes other than those for which it is originally intended, or has been operated in violation of applicable standards, general regulations, end user's internal rules or in violation o f  these instructions, it will automatically be terminated any warranties on this equipment.4 MAIN PARTS The illustration below is a sample model of a cyclone. The supplied models consist of the same components, differing only in size. 1 Cyclone body - cylindrical part5 Input flange 2 Cyclone body - conical part 6 Output flange 3 Expansion vessel 7 Rotary feeder 4 Support structure 5 DESCRIPTION AND FUNCTIONSThe cyclone separator is used to mechanically separate dust particles from of the extracted air. It is often used in wood processing and recycling plants operations. A cyclone separator is a device used to separate dust and other solid particles from a gas or liquid stream. The principle of its function is to create an eddy motion during which dust particles are separated from the air or gas. This technology is widely used in industry, especially in those areas where gases need to be cleaned of particulate matter, such as wood processing plants, recycling plants, steel mills. The cyclone separator is capable of removing particles larger than 10 micrometers, making it an effective tool for reducing airborne dust emissions. The cyclone separator consists of several main parts: the inlet, the separator body and the outlet for the purified gas. The dust particles are separated from the gas by the centrifugal force generated by the swirling of the gas inside the device. The separated dust is then collected at the bottom of the separator and can be further processed or removed. The selection of a particular model of cyclone separator, its features and equipment is a matter of commercial negotiation between the manufacturer and the operator and this manual does not describe all Variants. Variants cyclone separatorsCyclone separators differ in their design according to the nature of the materials - the dust to be Separate. The type of cyclone supplied to you is indicated on the delivery note. Cyclone separators can be used mainly for coarser dust particles, mainly as pre-paration, e.g. for wood shavings, wet wood dust, in recycling lines, dusting of biomass boilers, in food processing plants, etc., where we assume a separation efficiency of max. 70-95%. G&G Cyclone separator The cyclone separator consists of a cyclone body, a supporting steel structure, an expansion vessel, a rotary feeder (optionally) and a waste hopper. The maximum temperature of the air entering the cyclone is according to the type of cyclone material. Up to 300 °C in standard S235JR steel in temperature resistant paint, or up to 600 °C in stainless steel. Exhaust fan not included (can be offered separately). Retriev ed from dustThe centrifuged air in the form of clean air is blown into the surrounding space or is led further to the filtration unit where a higher degree of filtration occurs. 6 TECHNICAL DATA EXIT CONCENTRATIONThe guaranteed dust removal rate is between 70-95% depending on the type of dust and the extraction conditions.

The collection efficiency of a cyclone improves as thenumber of revolutions made by the gas and the gas velocity increase. Ultimately, however, theoverall performance depends on the particle size distribution of the incoming gas stream. Cyclones are generally used for collection of medium-sized and coarse particles. Cyclone designs can be classified according to the manner by which the gas stream enters and exits the cyclone as:  tangential inlet, axial dust outlet; tangential inlet, peripheral dustoutlet; axial inlet, axial dust outlet; and axial inlet, peripheral dust outlet. In general, a vortex iscreated in the cylinder by injecting gas tangentially or using a spin vane. In the cyclone, the gasmakes one or more revolutions, spiraling toward the bottom or end of the cyclone. Because ofinertia, the particles resist the direction change as the gas turns, and they migrate toward thecylinder walls. Near the bottom of the cylinder, the gas changes direction and turns back towardthe outlet duct, flowing through the center of the spiral; the particles are discharged downward or tangentially and are collected in a hopper. Cyclones have a relatively simple construction and generally have no moving parts. Simple cyclones consist of an inlet cylindrical section, conical section, outlet gas duct, outletdust tube, and collection hopper; a cyclone uses an induced draft fan to move the gas streamthrough the device. They are sized to provide the maximum inlet velocity possible for highseparation without excessive turbulence. Multiclones (or multicyclones) consist of multiplesmall-diameter tubes in parallel, each of which acts like a small cyclone. This configurationcombines the high efficiency of a small diameter with the ability to treat large gas volumes. Multiclone collection efficiency can be further improved by slip-streaming, in which a smallportion of the gas is drawn through the collection hopper to create suction on the dust outlet tubeand reduce dust re-entrainment into the multiclone tubes. Multiclones are sized to include theminimum number of tubes needed to treat the required gas volume without exceeding themaximum flow per tube. Common operational problems experienced with cyclones and multiclones include erosion of cyclone components that come into contact with high velocity particles; plugging of the dust outlet or the gas inlet vanes; corrosion from contact with acid gases in the inlet gasstream; and air inleakage that affects the inlet velocity and control efficiency of the cyclone. B.12.2 Indicators of Cyclone Performance The primary indicators of the performance of cyclones are the outlet opacity and inlet velocity. Other indicators of cyclone performance are the pressure differential across thecyclone and inlet gas temperature. Each of these indicators is described below. Table B-12 liststhese indicators and illustrates potential monitoring options for cyclones.Review DRAFT CAM  TECHNICAL GUIDANCE DOCUMENT B.12  CYCLONES 4/02 B-109Opacity . As is the case for all dry PM controls, opacity is an indicator of control device performance. An increase in opacity or visible emissions generally corresponds to a decrease incyclone performance. Inlet velocity or Inlet gas flow rate . Among other factors, cyclone control efficiency is a function of inlet velocity. As velocity increases, the inertial forces acting on particles in the gasstream increase, as does the likelihood that particles will impact the cyclone wall and betransported to the collection hopper. However, as velocity increases, turbulence forms in the gasstream and disrupts gas flow. Beyond a critical velocity, control efficiency decreases with increasing velocity. Below this critical velocity, decreases in velocity result in reductions incontrol efficiency. Pressure differential . Because pressure differential across a cyclone is primarily a function of velocity, it can be used as a surrogate for velocity measurements. Therefore, up tothe pressure differential that corresponds to the critical velocity, control efficiency increases withincreasing pressure differential. Inlet temperature . As temperature increases, gas density decreases, which can result in a decrease in collection efficiency. A change in gas temperature and density affects the inletvelocity. Monitoring inlet temperature applies to control of thermal processes only. However,the other parameters listed above are more reliable indicators of cyclone performance.

Al - though every possible risk has been considered, it is possible that besides the risks deriving from improper use, the following risks may occur: 7 Commercial Series Cyclone Owners Manual April 2012 Features Description of the Cyclone. For the separation of suspended substances in a fluid current, the Cyclone Separator is based on the prin - ciple of mechanical separation by means of centrifugal force (Cyclone Separator Principle). The fumes sucked by a fan located downstream of the Cyclone Separator are forced to move in a tangentially inside a cylinder. The solid particles, carried by the fluid current, are launched against the cylinder walls where, due to the force of gravity acting against them, they lose speed and fall. It is possible to improve the separation capacity of a cyclone separator sub-dividing it into multiple smaller cyclones, considering that if the walls travel at the same speed, the angular speed of the particles is inversely proportional to the wall’s radius. The cen - trifugal force increases with the angular speed square, therefore the friction on the walls of a cyclone with a smaller diameter also increase. The Cyclone Separator consists of a fume input cham - ber in which small cylinders, composed of cylindrical hoppers equipped with a system that forces the fluid current to move in a rotary manner, are installed at the bottom. The fumes, after having traveled a certain part of the cylindrical hopper, are forced to change direction and go up into vertical ducts that, crossing over the input chamber, release them into a plenum from which they are then sucked by a centrifugal fan. The solid parts, separated from the fumes by the cen - trifugal force and by the abrupt change in direction are accumulated in a bucket placed at the base of the cylinder outlets. 8 Commercial Series Cyclone Owners Manual April 2012 Features Performance The capacity to remove particles via centrifuge separation is directly proportional to the average diameter and weight of the particles. The efficiency of separation of this type of Cyclone Separator is influenced by many fac - tors including the following: • size of the suspended solid particles • average weight of the solid particles • humidity content of the fumes • ambient air temperature • temperature of the fumes The Cyclone Separator is designed to remove dust deriving from the biomass combustion fumes in special heat generators. The term \"biomass\" in generic terms, refers to a number of products of plant origin that, often times, only have one thing in common, that is, that they contain a mass of plant fibres and a more or less el - evated humidity content. Biomass products may include those with low moisture content, such as dry wood, sawdust, wood chips, pel - lets, nutshells, nuts etc. or products that have an average humidity content including pruning, branches, corn etc. of products with high humidity content such as grass, leaves, and grape-seeds etc. During combustion, each of these products produces fumes that contain solid particles with varying quantities and dimensions. Particle removal efficiency is determined using the ratio of the weight of the dust entering and that exiting; the removal tests carried out with the test fuel have shown an average efficiency that exceeds 50% for particles of dimensions exceeding 0.002”. Since it is not possible to predict all operation conditions with regard tothe combustible used, the removal efficiency de - clared by the Manufacturer refers to the test combustible as established by table 8 of Law EN 303-5 included in part C “com -"}

To facilitate transport, Cyclone Separator model MTC 8000 can be supplied in two pieces. Transport and Handling Handling operations must be carried out with adequate vehicles that have a capacity equal to or exceeding the weight indicated on the identification plate. Installation and testing Testing may be carried out only once the Cyclone Separator has been installed completely, that is, positioned and levelled out, and connected to the electrical panel, heat generator and chimney vent. Cyclone Separator installation must be completed by qualified personnel.11 Commercial Series Cyclone Owners Manual April 2012 Operation START-UP Checks before Start-up Before starting up the Cyclone it is important to: • Ensure that the heat generator is ready to be switched-on. • Make sure that the flow control valve is not closed. Start-up Unless otherwise specified, the fan and multi-cyclone start-up controls are located on the control panel of the heat generator. Therefore, start-up the Cyclone Separator is the result of a command coordinated by and de - pendent on the heat generator. ADJUSTMENT General information The efficiency of filtration, as explained on page 7, depends on many factors that are difficult to influence (hu - midity and weight of the combustible, outside air temperature) or that can be influenced by adjusting the heat generator (temperature of fumes, flow of fumes). The efficiency of dust removal is connected to the fume flow and consequently its speed of passage through the Cyclone Separator: A speed that is too low results in: • an accumulation of ashes in the fume tubes and in the fume fittings of the heat generator • poor filtration due to a lack of centrifugation on the cyclone walls A speed that is too high results in: • the excessive transport of hot ashes in the Cyclone Separator • poor filtration due to the transport of average sized solid particles for the curren fluid flow e ff e c t12 Commercial Series Cyclone Owners Manual April 2012 Cleaning The Cyclone Separator, given its unique function, must be periodically emptied and the solid parts that have been eliminated must be removed. Cleaning the Cylinder-holder plates Given the geometric arrangement of the cyclones within the suction chamber, it is possible that during adjust - ment some suspended particles may be deposited before being centrifuged. The side seal doors allow for ac - cess to the suction chamber for ash removal. Cleaning the suction plenum The fumes, after having passed through the cyclones, are collected in an upper plenum on which the fan connection fitting is located. The reduction in speed, consequent of the passage from the return tubes, of a restricted diameter, to the plenum chamber, may cause the depositing of residual ash on the plenum plate. To clean the plate, remove the fitting with the valve that connects the filter to the fan. Cleaning the fan The fan will need to be checked and cleaned regularly, to keep the system running properly and to prolong the life span of the parts. Disconnect power to the fan before cleaning or servicing, and allow to cool. Refer to the manual for the fan for proper cleaning procedures. WARNING! BEFORE CLEANING THE SEPARTOR, ENSURE THAT THE POWER IS DISCONNECTED13 Commercial Series Cyclone Owners Manual April 2012 Maintenance The filter must be subjected to regular maintenance. Maintenance must be carried out by qualified personnel. Routine maintenance The check and maintenance operations to be carried out periodically are as follows: Fan At the beginning of every season, clean the fan vanes (The accumulation of dust and other material on the fan vanes decreases its efficiency and compromises balancing, causing vibrations and noise) according to the cleaning procedure that is in the manual that you fan came with. Doors Check and clean the seals on the inspection door(s) to ensure a proper seal and to prevent leaks.

Doors Check and clean the seals on the inspection door(s) to ensure a proper seal and to prevent leaks. Rotary Valve If your Cyclone is equipped with a rotary valve it will need to be cleaned at the end of the season. To clean, allow the rotary valve to run until no ash is present. SHUT OFF the power to the rotary valve and allow to cool before manually cleaning. To clean, open the door on the cyclone and use a wire brush, or similar to clean the valve. Apply a rust inhibitor to the rotary valve to prevent corrosion during the off season. Cyclone Separator The Cyclone should be emptied and cleaned of ash at the end of the season shutdown. SHUT OFF power and allow the Cyclone to cool before cleaning. Empty all ash from the cyclone and clean any ash from the sides of the cyclone. Apply a rust inhibitor to prevent corrosion during the off season. DECOMMISSIONING and SCRAPPING The Cyclone Separator is built entirely using ferrous materials and does not contain any material considered dangerous for the environment. Scrapping Once the Cyclone Separator has been decommissioned, it is considered “waste” as defined by national and European laws and must be handed over to companies that have a Regional Authorization to collect waster.14 Commercial Series Cyclone Owners Manual April 2012 Notes15 Commercial Series Cyclone Owners Manual April 2012 Warranty This Warranty is provided by Northwest Manufacturing, Inc. only for the bene/f_it of the, initial purchaser (Original Owner) of the Northwest Manufacturing, Inc.

It is the owner’s and the employer’s responsibility to adequately train the employee-operator in the proper and safe use of the equipment. Written safety programs and formal instruction are essential. All new employees must be made aware of company policies and operating rules, especially the established safety and health procedures. Refresher training of experienced employees in the potential hazards of the job is important. Up-to-date training records must be maintained at the job site. 9. Special attention must be devoted to outside contractors engaged to enter and perform work on equipment or in the workplace. Special care must be exercised to insure all such personnel are fully informed of the potential hazards and follow plant rules – with special emphasis on explosion proof electrical tools and cutting or welding in unsafe environments. 10. Keep the workplace cleaned up and free of dirt and dust at all times. Do not attempt to work on slippery or unsafe ladders or work platforms when maintenance or repair work is being performed on the Cyclone. 11. Do not climb on ladders or work on platforms unless maximum load rating is posted. Do not exceed maximum load ratings when installing or servicing the Cyclone. 12. Never allow any kind of metal or other foreign objects to enter a Cyclone while in operation, unless the system is specifically designed as a wire or metal reclaim system. 13. The Kice Cyclone has no moving parts. Therefore, access into the machine is not restricted. However, in some installations, there is a machine discharging material from the Cyclone. The accessory machinery feeding and discharging the material may be dangerous to personnel working on or around the Cyclone. 14. Operate safely at all times. Use personal protective equipment when and where appropriate, such as hard hats, helmets, gloves, earplugs, and eye protection devices. Keep personal protective equipment in good repair and convenient to the operator. 15. When carrying out cleaning, service or maintenance activities a dust mask should be worn. 16. The operator of the cyclone must ensure that adequate lightning conditions are provided at the set-up location. 17. It is ultimately the operator’s responsibility to implement the above listed precautions and insure proper equipment use, maintenance and lubrication.

These will be the lifting lugs and/or the frame mounts of the cyclone where it will be attached to a support structure (see figure above). Lifting the cyclone at any other point is hazardous and may compromise human safety as well as the structural integrity of cyclone itself. The cyclone must be lifted by a means with sufficient lifting capacity . CAUTION: Use the proper equipment when lifting or moving the Cyclone. Make sure all persons and obstructions are clear from path and installation area. Kice Cyclones may be supported in two different ways. Smaller cyclones may be designed to be supported by the duct work or machinery connected to them, but most are designed with frame mounts in order to be supported by an additional structure or framework (see figure above). The unit should only be mounted on a structure designed to support it. The cyclone must be separately grounded, and installed on steel construction intended for this purpose. Product inlet or outlet transitions are not designed to support the weight of accessory equipment such as an airlock valve. If the unit is installed outdoors, cross bracing from the angle iron frame may be required for wind loading connections. The Cyclone should be installed in a level position, to prevent material from flowing to one side of the unit, thereby ensuring proper and efficient operation. Remove all foreign material before fully enclosing and operating the cyclone. Place a bead of caulking (or any provided gasket material) to seal the inlet and outlet points of the cyclone during installation. Proper installation of the cyclone also includes assembling the duct work and required machinery to the cyclone, fully enclosing it for quality operation. The unit should only be operated once it is properly connected and fully encapsulated. All duct work or stacks should be independently supported as excess weight may distort the cyclone assembly, causing improper airflow which may affect the efficiency of the unit, and all subsequent points in the system. Mounting PointsLifting Lugs10 Kice industries , inc.cyclone  information  and operatinG  instructions  continued NOTE:  To ensure proper operation and optimum cyclone efficiency, inlet and outlet ductwork design is critical. The ductwork should have a length of straight section from the inlet and outlet of the cyclone that is at least five times the diameter of the duct. If this not possible, elbows in the ductwork should be oriented in a manner that refrains from countering the air rotation inside the cyclone. This will help maintain efficiency. Some acceptable examples include: An unacceptable example would include: Also to ensure proper rotation, verify the cyclone outlet is opposite the inlet on the cyclone body as shown in the above figures.11 Kice industries , inc.cyclone  information  and operatinG  instructions  continued General  operatinG  information The Kice Cyclone classifies dry particles on the basis of terminal velocity . It can make precise separations of particles having differences in terminal velocities. A particle having a lower terminal velocity will be picked up by air moving at a lower velocity than will a particle having a higher terminal velocity As the airflow is increased, particles having higher and higher terminal velocities are removed. The system should be designed with sufficient fan capacity so that the operator is able to remove more material than required. Fine-tuning the system can be accomplished by adjusting the airflow by use of a damper to that which corresponds to or exceeds the terminal velocity of all of the particles that are desired to be removed from the product stream. Since the terminal velocity of a particle is influenced by, not only the size of the particle, but also its shape and density, there are instances where small dense particles are lifted at the same airflow as large winged particles. Separation of these particles that have the same terminal velocity , but different size and shape, can be improved by a Kice Multi-Aspiration system, or by sifting (screening). The flow and arrangement of the equipment must be determined by the operator for each product and for each system on an individual basis. air Volume The air volume required for the Cyclone for a specific material is determined by testing or experience, and is engineered into the system by the designer. After installation, the air volume is fine tuned by observing the material as the air volume is varied by adjusting the damper provided with the fan. 4. s tart-uP Procedure 1.

Kice Cyclones are designed and built in a manner such that all wall thicknesses are sufficient to the point that danger due to wear and tear can be excluded. However , elbows, fans and separators in the system are subject to the normal wear expected in any system handling comparable stocks, so equipment must be examined regularly for signs of wear and damage. Painted surfaces must be cleaned by means of vacuuming and with an anti-static cloth. If heavy machine components must be dismantled to carry out service and maintenance activities, suitable lifting equipment must be used. Use the proper hardware torque values listed at the end of this manual for all maintenance and installation activity.12 Kice industries , inc.5. c yclone  maintenance  continued 1.

FUTURE SCOPE ABSTRACT To design a cyclone abatement system  for particulate control, it is necessary to accurately estimate cyclone performance. In this cyclone study, new theoretical methods for computing travel distance, numbers of turns and cyclone pressure drop have been developed. The  flow pattern and cyclone dimensions determine the travel distance in a cyclone. The number of turns was calculated based on this travel distance. The new theoretical analysis of cyclone pressure drop was tested against measured data at different inlet velocities and gave excellent agreement. The results show that cyclone pressure drop varies with the inlet velocity, but not with cyclone diameter. Cyclone cut -points for different dusts were traced from measured cyclone overall collection efficiencies  and the theoretical model for calculating cyclone overall efficiency. The cut -point correction models 2D2D cyclones were developed through regression fit from traced and theoretical cut -points Diameter. Experimental resul ts indicate that optimal cyclone design velocities, which are for 2D2D cyclones, should be determined based on standard air density. It is important to consider the air density effect on cyclone performance in the design of cyclone abatement systems. The t angential inlet generates the swirling motion of the gas stream, which forces particles toward the outer wall where they spiral in the downward direction. Eventually the particles are collected in the dustbin located at the bottom of the conical section of the cyclone body. The cleaned gas leaves through the exit pipe at the top. In Pakistan it has been installed in many industries its Main modes of operation is similar to collect the particles but the collection of particles and m ethod of collection are Distinguish.

INTRODUCTION Floor cleaning is achieved by different technique which might be of different kinds. Different types of floor need different type of treatment. The floor should be totally dry after the cleaning process. Otherwise it may result in hazard. On some floors sawdust is used to absorb all ki nds of liquid s. This ensures that there will  no need of preventing them from spill of. The sawdust has to be swept and replaced every day. This process is still used in butchers but it was common in bars in the past. In some places tea leaves are also used  to collect dirt from carpets and also for odour removing purposes. Different types of floor cleaning machines are available today such as floor buffers, automatic floor scrubbers and extractors that can clean almost all types of hard floors or carpeted fl ooring surfaces in very less time than it would have taken using traditional cleaning methods. Again the cleaning would be different for different  floorings. 1. CYCLONE DUST COLLECTOR 1.1 WORKING  PRINCIPLE Materials flow two locations. This phenomenon is the basic working principle of an ideal vacuum from one location to another when a pressure difference is created between cleaner. When a centrifugal fan rotates it makes the air to flow by adding it external kinetic energy. Air is sucked from behind and pushed forward with pressure and so negative pre ssure is creates behind the fan. Ideal vacuum cleaners have  such centrifugal fan in it connected to a motor. This unit has suction and discharge connections, on the suction side filter bag is fitted before the hose connection. The discharge has another air  purifier filter and opened to atmosphere. When the electric power is given the motor rotates and so that the centrifugal fan. Air from the suction side is sucked into the unit along with the air all air born particles, cat allergen, mist, dirt, and small solid particles are carried to the auction filter. They are trapped in the filter and dirt free air is pushed out from the discharge opening . 2.

Often used interchangeably with “Fans,” blowers are defined by the ASME as having a ratio of discharge pressure over suction pressure between 1.11 and 1.2, while fans are defined as anything below this ratio and compressors are defined as anything above it. Some makers of portable fans refer to their units as blowers even  if they do not necessarily conform to the ASME distinction, which applies to permanently installed industrial process equipment. Another kind of blower is the mobile or hand held device used for moving fallen leaves. Centrifugal Blowers The centrifugal blower  use high speed impellers or blades to impart velocity to air or other gases. They can be single or multi -stage units. Like fans, centrifugal blowers offer a number of blade orientations, including backward curved, forward curved, and radial. Blowers can b e multi - or variable speed units. They are usually driven by electric motors, often through a belt and sheave arrangement, but some centrifugal blowers are directly coupled to drive motors. Fan speed can be changed to vary flow rates by resizing sheaves, u sing variable speed drives, etc., but dampers are even more common as a means of adjusting flow. Fan affinity laws dictate that a percent reduction in speed will produce a like reduction in flow. Main term s Blades: Backward inclined and forward curved refer to centrifugal blowers and relate to the blades also relate to centrifugal units, representing simple paddle type construction with no backward or forward inclinations. They can be self - orientation of the blades. Forward curving blades move larger quantities of air than backward inclined blades do, albeit at lower pressures. Backward inclined blades tend toward higher efficiencies. Radial cleaning, an important consideration for blowers handling dirty media. Airfo il blades also apply to centrifugal blowers. Flow Capacity : This attribute is important when selecting a blower. Blower capacity is generally rated in cubic feet per minute. Maximum Operating Pressure : Along with flow capacity, this is another important attribute in blower selection. Manufactures generally rate this item in inches of water column. 2.2 CYCLONE SEPARATOR Cyclone separators provide a method of removing particulate matter from air or other gas streams at low cost and l ow maintenance. Cyclones are somewhat more complicated in design than simple gravity settling systems, and their removal efficiency is much better than that of settling chamber. Cyclones are basically centrifugal separators, consists of an upper cylindrica l part referred to as the barrel and a lower conical part referred to as cone . They simply transform the inertia force of gas particle flows to a centrifugal force by means of a vortex generated in the cyclone body. The particle laden air stream enters tangentially at the top of the barrel and travels downward into the cone forming an outer vortex. The increasing air velocity in the outer vortex results in a centrifugal force on the particles separating them from the air stream. When the air reaches the bot tom of the co ne, it begins to flow radially  inwards and out the top as clean air/gas while the particulates fall into the dust collection chamber attached to the bottom of the cyclone. DIFFER ENT CYCLONE MODELS : 2.3 WATER SPRINKLER A sprinkler system is integrated system of piping, connected to a water supply, with listed sprinklers that automatically init iate water discharge over a  area where required. As water sprays from a sprinkler it breaks up into small drops between 0.5 and 4.0 mm in size. The small drops fall close to the sprinkler whereas the larger ones fall close to the edge of the wetted circle. Drop size is also controlled by pressure and nozzle size. When the pressure is low, drops tend to be much larger as the water jet does not break up easily. So to avoid more wetting of soil use small diameter nozzles operating at or above the normal recommended operating pressure. 2.3 FRAME 1.

Casters are essentially special housings that include a wheel, facilitating the installation of wheels on objects. Casters are found virt ually everywhere, from office desk chairs to shipyards, from hospital beds to automotive factories. They range in size from the very small furniture casters to massive industrial casters, and individual load capacities span 100 pounds (45  kg) or less to 10 0,000 pounds (45 t). Wheel materials include cast iron, plastic, rubber, polyurethane, forged Applications : Casters are available in a large selection of various rigs and yokes, wheel materials, swivel offsets, and wheel configur ations. In many cases, it can become extremely difficult to choose the right caster for the application. In order to help the user to determine the right caster to use, it's important to take a couple of factors into consideration, which include: • Load capa city (the total load applied on the casters) • The number of casters to be used on the equipment (usually four or six casters) • Floor type (concrete, steel, linoleum, carpet, etc.) • Floor condition (are there cracks, bumps, unlevel floors?) • Environment (is the  equipment operating in high temperatures, wet or humid conditions, etc.) • Floor cleanliness (are the floors clean or contain debris such as metal chips, grease, gravel, etc.) Steel, stainless steel, aluminium, and more. 2.5  DC MOTOR A DC motor  is any of a class of rotary electrical machines that converts direct current electrical energy into mechanical energy. The most common types rely on the forces produced by magnetic fields. Nearly all types of DC motors have s ome internal mechanism, either electromechanical or electronic; to periodically change the direction of current flow in part of the motor. DC motors were the first type widely used, since they could be powered from existing direct -current l ighting power distribution systems. A DC motor's speed can be controlled over a wide range, using either a variable supply voltage or by changing the strength of current in its field windings. Small DC motors are used in tools, toys, and appliances. The  universal motor  can operate on direct current but is a lightweight motor used for portable power tools and appliances. Larger DC motors are used in propulsion of electric vehicles, elevator and hoists, or in drives for steel rolling mills. The advent of powe r electronics has made replacement of DC motors with  AC motors  possible in many applications. OPERATION OF DC MOTOR: 1. When the coil is powered a magnet field is produced around   the armature the left side of the armature is pushed away from  the left magnet and drawn towards right, causing  rotation. 2. The  armature continues to rotate. 3. When  the armature becomes horizontally aligned, the commutator reverses the direction of Current through the coil, reversing the magnetic field. 4. The process then repeats. • Magnetic force acts perpendicular to both w ire and magnetic field. F=ILB I=Electric current F=Magnetic force B=Magnetic field L=Length of wire ADVANTAGES: • Provide excellent speed control for acceleration and deceleration. • Easy to understand design. • Simple, cheap drive design. DISADVANTAGES OF DC MOTOR: Brush wear: Since they need brushes to connect the rotor winding. Brush wear occurs, and it increases dramatically in low pressure environment. So they cannot be used in artificial hearts. If used on air crafts, the brushes would  need replacement after one hour of operation. Sparks from the brushes may cause explosion if the environment contains explosive materials. RF noise from the brushes may interfere with nearby t.v. sets, or electronic devices etc.., 2.6 DC ADAPTORS An AC adapter , AC/DC adapter , or AC/DC converter [1] is a type of external  power supply, often enclosed in a case similar to an  AC plug. Other common names include  plug pack , plug-in adapter , adapter block , domestic mains adapter , line power adapter , wall wart , power brick , and power adapter . Adapters for battery -powered equipment may be described as chargers  or rechargers  (see also  battery charger). AC adapt ers are used with electrical devices that require power but do not contain internal components to derive the required voltage and power from  mains power. The internal circuitry of an external power supply is very similar to the design that would be used fo r a built -in or internal supply. External power supplies are used both with equipment with no"}

The internal circuitry of an external power supply is very similar to the design that would be used fo r a built -in or internal supply. External power supplies are used both with equipment with no other source of power and with  battery -powered equipment, where the supply, when plugged in, can sometimes charge the battery in additio n to powering the equipment. Use of an external power supply allows portability of equipment powered either by mains or battery without the added bulk of internal power components, and makes it unnecessary to produce equipment for use only with a specified power source; the same device can be powered from 120 VAC or 230  VAC mains, vehicle or aircraft battery by using a different adapter. Another advantage of these designs can be increased safety; as the hazardous 120 or 240  volt mains power  is transformed to a lower safer voltage at the wall outlet, and the appliance which is handled by the user is powered by this lower voltage. 3.CIRCUIT DIAGRAM OF CYCLONE DUST COLLECTO R BLOWER:  Blowers use high speed impellers or blades to impart velocity to air or other gases. They can be single or multi -stage units. Like fans, centrifugal blowers offer a number of blade orientations, including backward curved, forward curved, and radial. Blowers can be multi - or variable speed units. They are usually driven by electric motors, often through a belt and sheave arrangement, but some centrifugal blowers are directly coupled to drive motors. BLOWER OUTLET : The blower outlet let all the dust particles into the throw out bin with which we can collect all the dust in a bin and make the required work done. CYCLONE CYLINDER:  It is one kind of a passage of the system which helps in flow of dust particles into the cone and then to the throw out  bin. DIRTY AIR INLET:  It is the passage through which the waste which is being collected is entering the system. CONE : The conical shaped container where the cone shape creates a cyclone with higher centrifugal air speed  and helps in collecting all the dust particles into the throw out bin . THROWOUT BIN:  It is the bin which collects all the dust particles in it  and can be opened when required for emptying the bin . MOTOR:  It converts  electrical energy into hydraulic energy. CONTROL VALVE:  The control valve helps in the controlled passage for the air/water and the required amount can be passed through the passage. WATER CONTAINER:  The water container is for the storage of the water for sprinkling the water on the cleaned surface. HOSE: The hose pipe is for carrying the collected air for the inlet to the outlet and it acts as the passage for the dust collection. T-JOINT:  The t -joints are used for connecting purpose, in which two pipes can be connected and make a passage for collecting the dust. L-JOINT: The L -joint is also known as angle joint it is of 90 ° angle and used for connecting pipes in the L shape and  make the passage for collecting the dust particles. 4.

FOOD & PHARMACEUTICAL Powder recovery cyclone filter in pharmaceutical sterile processes cyclone separator for product recovery in milk powder, coffee and cereal plants Cement Industry In cement manufacturing industries, large -sized cyclone separators are used as main process equipments in significant numbers for handling high volumetric flow rates of dust -laden gases. The cyclone is a simple mechanical device c ommonly used in the grinding circuits to remove relatively large particles from gas streams. Cyclones are often used as pre -cleaners to remove more than 80% of the particles greater than 20µm in diameter. Smaller particles that escape the cyclones can then  be collected by more efficient control equipment like bag filters and electro precipitators Cyclones are relatively inexpensive since they have no moving parts and they are easy to operate The most common type of cyclone is known as reverse flow cyclone s eparator Others: Cyclones are used in sawmills to remove sawdust from extracted air 5. CONCLUSION A prominent problem in calculating the efficiency of cyclone is the effect of flow characters in cyclone. In big cyclones the flow is turbulent and friction factors assumed give good results. This is not true for small cyclones. The flow in small cyclones can be laminar or even transitional. In such case the operational conditions, like velocity, temperature, pressure, viscosity and cyclone diameter, may be of significant importance and their effect changes from cy clone to cyclone. In laminar flow, operating parameters influence cyclone efficiency more than turbulent case. This makes the prediction of efficiency and pressure drop very difficult especially in small cyclone. Most of the models depend on empirical or s emi-empirical equations. The models calculate efficiency and predict the cutoff size which corresponds to 50% efficiency. According to Wang et al. cyclone performance is function of geometry and operating paramete rs of cyclone, as well as particle size distribution of the entrained particulate matter. Several models have been proposed to predict the efficiency of cyclone. It is widely agreed amongst the scientists that cyclone performance is definitely affected by operating parameters and hence they should be included in the modeling. Many theories account for density, gas velocity, viscosity and particle diameter. As far as effect of geometry is considered there is difference in approach for various scientists. Som e consider all the geometric parameters where as some consider only few important parameters like inlet and outlet diameter and height in their models. As mentioned, most of the theories consider cut size “d50”,  which corresponds to diameter of particle where 50% of particles smaller and 50% of particles greater that that size will be collected. Two most common approaches for calculating efficiency are Force Balance Theory [Lapple] which assumes that terminal vel ocity is achieved when drag fore   and centrifugal force equal each other and the Static Particle Approach [Barth] which considers simple force balance where forces acting on particle are balanced. Various other complicated theories have been proposed but the essentially have their base in one of the two theories. 6. FUTURE  SCOPE In the future, state implementation plans and local environmental regulations will need to consider the energy consumption of control devices and not just stack total emissions, as producing electricity to operate control devices results in pollution where  that electricity is generated .Future cyclone research will continue to focus on collection effectiveness, especially for finer particulates, but will also focus on minimizing energy costs. As computing resources become less expensive and CFD modeling becomes more sophisticated, increasingly complex models will continue to contribute to our still imperfect understanding. Yet numerical simulation will always require validation trials that test cyclones under conditions and loads as near to the r eal world application as feasible. As methods for quantification of particulate emission particle size distributions become more affordable, the quality of the data collected in these future trials  should further improve ."}

In analysing the numerous refere nces which are available, the reader finds great difficulty in isolating basic facts on which he can begin to build his understanding. The first rule which is generally accepted is the simple empirically proved fact that the end product, which can be term ed as ‘collecting efficiency’, is related to energy expended. In more basic terms we set out the rough yardstick ‘collecting efficiency’ increases as the ‘water gauge’ goes up. There are exceptions to this rule as in the case of the multi -cellular cyclon e, which uses a number of small cyclonets housed within a plenum chamber. The rule of thumb ‘CE is proportional to WG” is modified with formula too complicated and bulky to discuss in this text; our comment is confined to broad generalizations in the hope  that reader may pass on to informative references, which deal with the subject in detail. With all cyclone work it must be appreciated that to separate the particles from the airstream tangential entry and airspeed are necessary to create a vortex which does the spiralling action of downward and upward air movement; this is in essence all that the fabricated steel shell and inner thimble induces. The density of the particle will determine together with its shape and size what can be done with it once it enters the cyclone. It is impossible to supply momentum to an object if the object is not capable of receiving it. To explain this more fully let us consider two balls each measuring two inches diameter. The first ball can be a balloon; this is a plastic  skin containing air which pressurizes to maintain spherical shape. The second can be more dense, say something like a cricket ball. Now we imagine the human arm throwing object 1 (the balloon), the thrower expends energy, say 200 ft and the ball travels no more than 5ft. In the case of object 2 (the cricket ball), the same amount of energy is expended and the ball travels 100 yards. This simply means certain physical characteristics are required before one can create momentum from air speed and the tang ential entry on the cyclone in order that the dust may be centrifuged out. After appreciating that density plays a part in the behaviour of the particle the next consideration is that of shape. The physical contours of the particle are of the utmost impo rtance, they determine the sail cloth effect that resists natural settling in free air. Particles are never truly spherical; all shapes are involved, varying between two uniformed extremes, i.e., the ball bearing and the postage stamp, which has a very hi gh sail effect with resultant slow settling rate. The problems involved in calculating settling rates are relatively easy if the particle is of uniformed shape. In considering any dust sample it inevitably transpires that the shapes are anything but unif ormed, this makes calculation labourious and in some cases well nigh impossible. At this stage special equipment is employed to aid analysis. This equipment consists of a long thin transparent tube coupled at the base with an air connection and required auxillaries to meter 5 airflow. The dust sample is placed in the tube and air is introduced to create a fluidizing action; the performance of the particles are noted, some will fall against the airflow, others will be blown up the tube to be captured in a c ontainer interconnected  with the equipment. Numerous tests are carried out at varying up -draft velocities and the physical performance of the dust recorded. This method known as elutriation or terminal velocity analysis automatically"}

Numerous tests are carried out at varying up -draft velocities and the physical performance of the dust recorded. This method known as elutriation or terminal velocity analysis automatically takes into accoun t particle shape, weight and size. With the application of Stokes law, which expresses terminal velocity for spherical particles of known specific gravity and size the dust to be handled can be specified. The unit of measurement is the micron (1/1000th millimetre) the analysis will record the percentage weights through a range of micron sizes. On completion of the analysis consideration is then given in order to place the dust to be collected into a category where it can be handled  by a particular type o f cyclone. Having placed the dust into a category where a certain type of unit is best suited, the diameter of the cyclone (or cyclones) has to be investigated. In some instances several small units are desirable in preference to one big one. To appreci ate this point more fully the happenings within the cyclone must be understood. The body of the unit in conjunction with the thimble induces a vortex. Air enters the inlet port and screws down the body of the cylinder in company with dust particles. The  body diameter can be thought of as a deflector plate working in conjunction with the tangential inlet. See figure 1. If we consider Fig. 2 where we have the tangential inlet with two distinct body diameters superimposed it can be appreciated that for eq ual conditions of air speed, shape and S.G. the smaller body diameter will have contact with the particle in advance of its bigger counterpart. The figures analysing types G, M, H and MC can now be understood. In the case of the ‘G’ inlet speed increa ses as the body diameter goes up in order to counteract the angular distance travelled before the particle comes into contact with the cyclone body. As pressure consumption measured in inches water gauge is a function of inlet speed it can be observed that the W.G. increase with body diameter. 6 When considering type M, H and MC  we have the reverse condition in the case of W.G. consumed; this is held constant throughout the range, this also means that the inlet port speed is standard for all sizes. As no attempt is made to counteract the efficiency drop with increasing size the maximum economical size is about 48”, although in some cases sizes up to 60” can be successfully applied in some cases. 7 These units have been  applied extensively by Dust air over the years , the largest at a rating of 30,000 cfm  (14.16 m3/s) on a 15ft  (4.57m)  body diameter. In the past the ‘G’  type has been used indiscriminately, but as time has progressed more informative information has come to hand, which has narrowed i ts suitability drastically. The cyclone was introduced approximately 70 years ago and the ‘G’  type that we know today varies very little from the original design. It has, however, done much to propagate the thinking and development of the other four main  groups of cyclones that are in use today, which are namely: - 8 G type   High throughput / Low Efficiency M type   Medium -High  throughput / Medium Efficiency H typ e  Low (relative) throughput / H igh Efficiency MC type  Multi -cellular  design for  optimised throug hput and efficiency In passing it is worth noting that the ‘G’  type cyclone  can be used as a coarse pre -cleaner in series with cyclones of higher efficiency to give classification or to take the buttress load prior to passing on to a bag filter. Its sing ular filter role is new in most cases confined to wood  waste and the rare grain, dried sugar beet and  polishing exhaust duties. In some cases ‘Z’  type cyclone s are now used on wood  waste which is the last stronghold of the ‘G’ type as the singular filter. It would be fair to say that as the Clean Air Acts become more stringent its role as the ‘only filter on line’ will be very rare indeed. It is impossible to isolate applications for which the types G , M, H and MC are suitable. Each case is treated as an individual consideration at the project stage, when points of durability, flexibility, efficiency and running costs, to mention, but a few points, are evaluated. In instances where sufficient quantities of dust are available tests are carried out by us  to ensure the suitability of the equipment offered.

Our engineers are experienced in the mec hanical installation of such systems, as well as associated ductwork, fans and filtration equipment. However, on some occasions the end user may wish to perform the installation themselves  or it may be arranged  through an agent . Care must be exercised whe n moving or lifting of the components that make up the cyclone , howeve r small. Some components are large and heavy , which could cause i njury if not handled correctly. Installation engineers must assess the mass  of the  components prior to attempting any manual lifting. Proprietary lifting equipment is readily available for hire which would assist in this task. Large cyclones tend to be installed using a crane or similar. In general, the cyclone will stand vertic ally as a relatively tall structure. Support is usually by a bespoke steel framework to which the cyclone is bolted via external mounting plates around its main circular body. The support frame will either comprise of a number of vertical legs or horizonta l beams, depending upon the application. Vertical legs need to be bolted down securely to a sound floor such as concrete, the thickness of which should be to suit the design loadings of the equipment placed upon it. Horizontal beams are used where the cycl one may be supported from adjacent building structures rather than from the floor. Consideration must be given to the stresses placed upon any structure by supporting the cyclone in this manner. GENERAL OPERATION As the cyclone  is a static piece of eq uipment, operating instructions tend to be included with the connected fan or filtration equipment. However, there are some  general  points to note, as follows: - Once commissioned, do not adjust balancing dampers  in the connected ductwork system Avoid dama ge to the cyclone Clean / maintain the cyclone  as specified EXPLOSION VENTING Note should be taken of the installation and mainten ance instructions concerning any proprietary ATEX explosion ven ting panel(s) fitted to the  cyclone and/or the  associa ted du ctwork system . These proprietary items are u sually manufactured by FIKE. Where  applicable , the appropriate literature is included within this document an d forms part of the overall  operating and maintenance instructions. Special attention must be paid to t he warning in relation to positioning of the explosion panel (s) where personal injury may occur in the event of the panel (s) bursting . 10 PRECAUTIONS IN USE The extraction systems are used in the removal  of dust  and/or fume  from a wide range of industrial  processes. Some applications may require special precautions in operating and/or maintenance due to the nature of the materials  being conveyed within the extraction system . Any safety procedures or advice given on material -specific COSHH data sheets shoul d be adhered to by the end user. General first aid advice is given here as a supplement to specific requirements for substances in u se on site. Consult the substance  data sheets for more advice. Splashes to the skin 1. Irrigate the affected area thoroughly with copious quantities of running water and continue for at least 10 minutes or until satisfied that no chemical remains in contact with skin. The removal of solvents, solutions and chemicals known to be insoluble in water will be facilitated by the use of soap. 2. Remove all contaminated cloth taking care not to contaminate yourself in the process. 3. Refer for medical advice to the nearest doctor or if warranted arrange transport to hospital. Provide information to accompany the casualty on the type of che mical responsible and brief details of the first aid treatment administered. Splashes to the eyes 1. Irrigate the eye thoroughly with copious quantities of gently running water from either a tap or eye wash bottle and continue for at least 10 minutes. If o nly one eye is affected do not allow contaminated water to flow into the uncontaminated eye. 2. Ensure the water bathes the eyeball by gently opening the eyelid and keeping them apart until treatment is complete. 3. All eye injuries from chemicals require medi cal advice. Arrange transport to hospital. Provide information to accompany the casualty on the type of chemical responsible and brief details of the first aid treatment administered. Ingestion of poisonous chemicals 1. If the chemical has been confined to the mouth then give large quantities of water as a mouth wash. Ensure that the mouth wash is not swallowed. 11 2. If the chemical has been swallowed then give copious amounts of water or milk to drink to dilute it in the stomach. 3. DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING! 4. Arrange for immediate transport to hospital.

Provide information to accompany the casualty on the type of chemical ingested with brief details of the first aid treatment administered and if possible an estimate of the quantity and concentration of the chem ical consumed. GENERAL MAINTENANCE IMPORTANT NOTE! At all times when carrying out maintenance and inspection  of the  cyclone,  duct systems,  the fan, rotary valves, etc. all  associated units must be electrically isolated and a minimum of three minutes must be allowed from the stopping of the fan before opening any access doors. This ensures that any rotating or mechanical parts  and air flow  will have come fully to rest before attempting inspection or maintenance. Daily (i)  Inspect the  cyclone and the connected  local exhaust ventilation system to ensure that there are no blockages or accumulation of material within the system. This includes inspection  of the cyclone discharge point, areas  adjacent to any  duct bends,  flexible joints or within hood conne ctions, as blockages will prevent the cor rect operation of the equipment. Accumulation in horizontal ducts can cause failure of supports due to the weight of material, with possible catastrophic results. Accumulation of material inside a cyclone will reduc e its operating efficiency. (ii)  Inspect the mechanical integrity of the  cyclone and connected  dust extraction system to ensure that there are no perforations, breaks or wear holes within the equipment. This would include the inspection of any flexible hoses t o ensure that these are not perforated, as again any air leakage will reduce the efficiency of the exhaust system  as a whole . Monthly Visually inspect  the cyclone,  ductwork and associated extraction components for signs of fatigue, wear or other faults. This is of particular importance in systems conveying abrasive dusts or large particulate where constant abrading of surfaces may occur. In such instances it is wise to perform these checks more frequently. 12 Six Monthly (i)  The impellor of any associa ted fan should be inspected with the aid of a torch for any signs of material build up on its blades. This can be done by electrically isolating the fan motor, then removing the bolted access panel on the outside of the curved fan casing. If desired, the impel ler can be removed externally by unbolting of the motor mounting plate. By suitably supporting the motor, the impellor, shaft and motor can be removed as one complete unit. It is recommended that the customer contact Dustair engineers before attempting r emoval of the motor or fan impeller assembly. It is inevitable that, over time, some build up of material will occur on the blades of the fan impellor. During normal operation a noisy or vibrating fan is indicative of this and Dustair should be contacted i n such a situation. DO NOT ALLOW THIS TO GO UNCHECKED  – IT WILL GET WORSE ! (ii)  Remove access panels on cyclone body and make internal inspections to assess condition and check for signs of excessive wear or fatigue. Annually In addition to the foregoing, it is a requirement of Health and Safety  / C.O.S.H.H. that an extraction system be tested for correct and safe operation every fourteen months or less. During such tests pressure  and flow rate readings are taken at various points on the extraction system  in order  to ascertain correct and efficient operation. Differential pressure readings are also taken on any connected filter unit to assess its condition and operational efficiency. Dustair Limited can provide engineers and equipment to carry out any of the above operations, with prices available upon request. 13 Appendix I FAN OPERATION & MAINTENANCE INSTRUCTIONS See fan manufacturer’s Instruction Manual 14 Appendix II PROPRIETARY EQUIPMENT OPERATING & MAINTENANCE INSTRUCTIONS See also any individual instruction manuals 15 16 17 18 Appendix III CERTIFICATION 19 EXAMPLE ONLY  20"}

Important Notice This manual contains important safety information and precautionary measures. It is impossible to list all potential hazards associated with every dust collection system in each application. Proper use of the equipment must be discussed with Parker Hannifin, Inc. or your local Cyclone representative. Operating personnel must be aware of, and adhere to, the most stringent safety procedures. 1.1 General Cautions On Using the Dust Control Unit 1. Avoid mixing combustible materials such as aluminum, paper, wood or other organic dusts with dusts generated from grinding or welding metals. A fire hazard could develop from sparks entering the dust collector. When collecting flammable or explosive materials, the dust collector should be located outdoors and incorporate the appropriate safety measures and/or accessories. 2. When collecting emissions from spark-producing processes, care must be taken to reduce any potential fire hazards. Dust collectors do not contain fire extinguishing equipment unless specifically ordered. Consult fire extinguishing experts for recommendations concerning proper fire detection and suppression systems. 3. Some dust collection systems require explosion venting. Consult your insurance underwriter, NFPA (National Fire Prevention Association) Manual and local fire authorities to determine requirements for explosion venting. 4. Be careful and conscientious—consult national and local fire codes, waste disposal, safety and other appropriate authorities. Comply with their recommendations for proper installation and operation of dust collection equipment. 2.

The primary mode of operation is the air cleaning operation. The separated dust is discharged into a collection container. The clean air is then exhausted into the atmosphere or further filtered through afterfilters. 2.3 Air Filtering Operation Normal operation consists of the air filtering operation and the resulting clean air discharge. During the air filtering operation, contaminated air is drawn into the Cyclone Dust Collector through the air inlet located on the upper barrel above the internal helix (see Figure 1). The contaminated air spirals downward and accelerates as the cone narrows whereby higher centrifugal forces are exerted on dust particles in the airstream. As the contaminated air travels down the cone, it accelerates and the particles are thrown to the periphery of the airstream. Aided by gravity, the heavy particles are discharged into a dust-tight container (i.e. drum or hopper). As the particles drop out, the exhaust airstream spirals upward inside the downward stream of contaminated air into the fan housing and is then exhausted into the atmosphere. * Standard 5’6” under hoppers.

Recommended Minimum Clearance 4. Installation 4.1 Off Loading and Inspection C-Series cyclone units are shipped with major components mounted on skids. The blower assembly will be pre-assembled to the upper barrel assembly. The orientation will have the inlet and outlet opposed 180° unless requested otherwise at the time of order. Other skids may contain afterfilter units or other accessory components. Inspection Note: Upon receipt of your unit, check for any shipping damage. A damaged carton indicates that the equipment may have received rough handling during shipping that may have caused possible internal damage. Notify your delivery carrier and enter a claim if any damage is found. 4.2 Installation Planning Selecting the proper location for your dust collection equipment is very important. See Figure 2 for typical installation details. Certain items should be considered when locating the unit, such as: room to empty the dust storage container(s) or hoppers; shortest run for location of ductwork; electrical connections; wall penetrations; fan discharge direction; afterfilters. Ease of maintenance should also be considered when selecting the location and orientation of the system (see Figure 3). ! WARNING •  Do not locate dust collector near dust source in cases where the dust is explosive or a fire hazard. •  In preparing to install the unit, ensure location is clear of all obstructions,  such as utility lines or roof overhangs.8 High Efficiency Cyclone Dust Collector    C SeriesThe Parker Cyclone Dust Collector is usually mounted on a reinforced concrete foundation. Other mounting options are possible. Structural calculations for the foundation or other mounting arrangement must include the weight of the cyclone, the material collected and the weight of all auxiliary equipment. These weights must be considered together with wind, seismic and other live load ratings when designing the support structure. See the Specification Table on page 2 for dust collector unit weights. Interconnecting ductwork (not provided with the Cyclone Dust Collector) should be designed and properly sized to handle the air volume at the recommended air velocities for the entrainment of dust into the collection system. When installing ductwork, use the shortest possible runs and large-radius elbows whenever possible. The shortest duct length with a minimum number of elbows will maximize the performance of the unit. Seal all joints. Follow ductwork design methods as listed in the Industrial"}

Seal all joints. Follow ductwork design methods as listed in the Industrial Ventilation Manual as recommended by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists. In the case of spark-producing processes, system design should incorporate measures to prevent live sparks from entering the dust collector. Consult local authorities for the location of the unit and any precautions to consider when collecting combustible, explosive or hazardous dusts. Review General Cautions listed on page iii. With any air-moving device, a certain amount of noise is created. Normally, the noise level is not as high as that of other machinery in the area. If you require an additional reduction in the noise level, exhaust silencers are available as optional equipment. Noise levels must be taken into consideration as you plan the installation of your equipment. 4.3 Assembly and Standard Equipment Drum Support Stand Assembly Place the base assembly of the unit in its desired location. Use shims under foot pads as needed to level unit. Once base is level, fasten down with properly sized anchor bolts (see Figure 4).Before you begin, remove all crating, strapping and hold-down bolts. Locate all hardware bags, silicone sealant and other assembly materials provided with your unit. Remove fan housing inspection door and examine the unit fan wheel. Make sure it moves freely and is firmly in place. Re-tighten if necessary. Replace door after inspecting. Check that motor mounts are secure. Parker Cyclone Dust Collectors are typically shipped in three main assemblies: 1. Upper barrel assembly - This section consists of the upper barrel and blower housing with motor. 2. Cone weldment - The cone is usually inverted and mounted inside the base support stand. 3. The base assembly - This consists of support base, legs, drum cover, hose and clamps. The inlet and outlet pieces will also typically be shipped with the base assembly.Use adequate safety measures when lifting and assembling any heavy components. Consult your plant safety personnel for recommendations. Never lift cyclone by the motor. Do not rest blower assembly on fan wheel. Use clevises (not hooks) on lifting sling. Use spreader bars on lifting sling.! WARNING ! CAUTION9 High Efficiency Cyclone Dust Collector    C SeriesIn preparing to assemble the hopper to its mating support base, connect a lifting sling to at least four positions on the unit. Distribute the load evenly. Location must be clear of all obstructions such as utility lines or roof overhangs.! WARNING Figure 4. One- and Two- Drum Base Assembly Hopper Support Stand Assembly Place the hopper base assembly in its desired location. Use shims under foot pads as needed to level unit. Once base is level, fasten down with properly sized anchor bolts. Shim and anchor the bottom section of the hopper first. Using the hardware provided, set the top section of the hopper on the base section (see Figure 5). Figure 5. C60H and C110H Hopper Base AssemblyCYCFIG4/510 High Efficiency Cyclone Dust Collector    C SeriesTake care to use proper lifting equipment and procedures. Drift pins may be useful for locating hopper mating sections. With the hopper section still supported, use hardware to bolt the sections together. Once all hardware is in place, go back and fully tighten all hardware on mating pads and all bracing. Disconnect the crane. Cone Assembly In preparing to assemble the cyclone to its stand or hopper, connect a lifting sling to at least four positions on the cyclone. Distribute the load evenly. Location must be clear of all obstructions such as utility lines or roof overhangs.! WARNING Install the cone assembly by setting the cone on top of the base. No sealant is required at this joint for the 1D and 2D units. Sealant is required for hopper base units. The cones are symmetrical so there is no specific orientation to consider. Using hardware provided, fully secure cone to base (see Figure 4). Inlet and Outlet Transition Installation Each Cyclone Dust Collector has its own bolt-on inlet and outlet transitions. The model C192 transitions are welded on the assembly. When mounting the inlet transition, always make sure the top of the transition is up. (see Figure 6). If the transition is mounted improperly, unit efficiency will be adversely affected. Do not attempt to change the size of the inlet. If the cyclone is operated with more than the maximum permissible inlet area, the motor may become overloaded. Inlet and Outlet Direction Change Check to be sure the inlet and the fan discharge are facing the desired direction. If not, they can be rotated. The inlets on the various models can be rotated as follows: Series C190 -  inlet can be rotated at 45° increments from the base. Series C200 and C240 -  inlets can be rotated at 45° increments. Series C3000 and C3600  -  inlets can be rotated at 221/2° increments. Series C4400 -  inlet can be rotated at 15° increments."}

Once correct positioning is obtained, lay two ribbons of sealant around the bolt circle of the fan housing and/or flange rings to ensure airtight seal. Re-bolt the fan housing. If discharge direction must be changed on the C3600 or C4400 series cyclones after unit has been delivered (or if collector must be moved), the upper cylinder/blower assembly must be re-oriented on the ground because of the considerable force that may be required to rotate the housing. Place the upper cylinder/blower assembly on the ground and firmly secure. To change the position of the housing discharge in relation to the inlet, proceed as follows: 1. Remove weather/belt guards. 2. Secure the blower package with a sling from a crane or forklift attached to the channel on the blower package. 3. Loosen and remove the bolts on the blower package cover plate. 4. Lift fan/motor assembly out of fan housing and support properly on ground. Do not rest fan on the ground, as the fan may become damaged.! CAUTION11 High Efficiency Cyclone Dust Collector    C Series5. Loosen and remove the bolts holding the blower housing to the upper cylinder. 6. Rotate blower housing to the desired position. Housing may stick because of sealant. Scrape the old sealant off the barrel top and fan housing, then reseal using silicone sealant. Apply a ribbon of sealant on both sides of bolt pattern. 7. Reassemble parts in reverse order. The blower package can now be re-installed. Apply a ribbon of sealant to each side of bolt circle on top of the blower housing. Gently lower the blower package in place, making sure the terminal box on the motor is facing desired direction. Use hardware provided and secure package. Figure 6. Typical Barrel/Blower Assembly Barrel/Blower Assembly Ensure that the inlet and outlet flanges are facing the desired direction. If the inlet and outlet directions need to be changed, see previous section “Inlet and Outlet Direction Change” before continuing. After ensuring that inlet and outlet direction are correct, use two ribbons of sealant on each bolt-up flange (see Figure 6).CYCFIG612 High Efficiency Cyclone Dust Collector    C Series4.4 Assembly of Optional Equipment AF-Series Afterfilter Assembly On AF (afterfilter) models, the filter section is shipped in several containers. The filter section of model C192 consists of elbow, flange assembly, filter bag and clamp. On the larger cyclone models, the filter section consists of three main sections: 1. Transition 2. Plenum sections 3. Filter bags and clamps On all afterfilter models, use a ribbon of sealant between blower housing discharge flange and the mating flange of the afterfilter transition. If required, bolt afterfilter plenum to transition using additional sealant. Install proper ceiling supports or floor supports for the afterfilter housing. Install filters with the appropriate clamps. Make sure bags and clamps are both on the flange collar of the plenum (see Figure 7B). Figure 7A.

Disconnect electrical power before installing or servicing any electrical equipment. See Figure 13 for wiring connections.! WARNING NOTE:  All electrical work must be performed by a qualified electrician according to the most stringent applicable codes. Be sure to use proper size starter, conduit and wiring for blower motor. Start fan motor and visually check for proper rotation as indicated by the “rotation arrow” decal on the fan housing. NOTE:  While rotating backwards, the fan will still deliver approximately 40% of its rated air volume but will require more horsepower than proper rotation. It is extremely important to ensure proper fan rotation. If your collector has a belt-driven blower wheel, DO NOT attempt to make any pulley changes. Each pulley is sized for proper operation prior to shipment. No changes should be made unless specifically directed by Parker Hannifin.17 High Efficiency Cyclone Dust Collector    C SeriesFigure 12.

Operation 5.1 Start-Up Inspect the installation area and make certain no tools, parts, etc. have been left anywhere on or inside the unit. Check the fan discharge to make certain it is free from all debris. Start fan motor and check for proper rotation. A rotation arrow is located on the fan housing. If the fan is rotating in the opposite direction, disconnect the power to the motor starter, interchange any two wires on the output side of the starter (three-phase systems only), engage starter disconnect, then start fan and recheck rotation. Before each start-up, verify that hopper slide gates are closed. DUST-HOG High Efficiency Cyclone Dust Collector drum lids with gasketing and drums must be firmly in place and tight fitting. Ductwork slide gates must be open. Check exhaust for any obstruction. To operate the cyclone dust collector, simply turn on the blower. NOTE:  Running fan in incorrect rotation for an extended period of time will cause fan motor damage and reduce life of fan motor. Adjust airflow with volume control damper(s) (not supplied by Parker) on individual ductwork drops. 5.2 Check List Always verify that any hopper slide gates are closed and that the doors, drum lids and gaskets are in place. The material being collected will not separate from the airstream if any leakage occurs around the base or drum. Failure to adhere to these instructions may also cause the motor to overload. Verify that exhaust air remains visibly clean. If an emission develops, examine drums, drum lids, etc. for possible leaks.The blower compartment bolt-on panel must be installed before operating the dust collector.! CAUTION 6. Service Shut off the unit. Disconnect and lockout all electrical power to the dust collector prior to performing service work.! CAUTION BEFORE SERVICING, NOTE THE FOLLOWING: 1. Disconnect electrical power to the unit and control panel. 2. Wear appropriate protective clothing when servicing the dust collector. 3. Collected dust may be hazardous. Consult proper authorities for handling and disposal. 4. Collected dust may be a potential fire hazard. DO NOT perform grinding or operations involving open flames unless fire protection measures are in place. Refer to Section 1 for additional precautions. 5. Disposal of collected dust must be according to state and local environmental regulations.20 High Efficiency Cyclone Dust Collector    C Series6.1 Dust Removal Turn off the dust collector and empty the dust storage drum/container as necessary to prevent dust from accumulating. Empty the dust storage drum or hopper when two-thirds full. If dust levels in storage containers are allowed to accumulate to a high level, dust may be drawn through the unit and discharged out the exhaust. NOTE:  Do not allow the drum or hopper to overfill. This can cause poor collector performance and require extensive cleanup if the dust overflows when the collecting device is removed. 6.2  Servicing the Direct Drive Motor and Fan (C190-C3000) ! WARNING All electrical work should be done by a qualified electrician in accordance with local electrical codes. Disconnect electrical power before installing or servicing any electrical component.

Periodically inspect the fan blades to ensure proper fan life. Clean the fan to remove any deposited material if required. For motor maintenance, follow the manufacturer’s directions. If your motor requires servicing under the motor manufacturer’s warranty, contact an authorized service center. Motors are greased at the factory and do not need lubrication at time of installation. However, regreasing may be necessary after 1,000 hours of use. As a guideline, grease the motor every 3,600 hours with high grade ball and roller bearing grease. Recommended greases are Shell Dolium R or Chevron SRI#2.21 High Efficiency Cyclone Dust Collector    C SeriesAll electrical work should be done by a qualified electrician in accordance with local electrical codes. Disconnect electrical power before installing or servicing any electrical component.! WARNING For motor maintenance, follow the manufacturer’s directions. If your motor requires servicing under the motor manufacturer’s warranty, contact an authorized service center. Motors are greased at the factory and do not need lubrication at time of installation. However, regreasing may be necessary after 1,000 hours of use. As a guideline, grease the motor every 3,600 hours with high grade ball and roller bearing grease. Recommended greases are Shell Dolium R or Chevron SRI#2. All bearings used are sealed, have been lubricated at the factory and do not need lubrication at the time of installation. Subsequent lubrication will be required and the motor and bearing manufacturer’s recommendations should be followed. Use the following instructions as guidelines. The fan bearings should be relubricated at six week intervals when utilized for eight-hour workday operations. The fan bearings should be relubricated more frequently if operation time is longer than eight hours per day. When lubricating, be sure to grease both bearings and use high grade medium weight ball bearing grease. It is also recommended that you consult your lubricant supplier regarding proper greases for both the motor and fan bearings. Proper grease should be based on hours of usage and environmental conditions. If any bearing operates roughly, the unit should be shut down and the bearing replaced immediately.6.3 Servicing the Belt Driven Fan and Motor (C3600-C4400)22 High Efficiency Cyclone Dust Collector    C Series6.4  Belt Adjustment and Replacement The belts on your new unit have been properly adjusted at the factory. However, before operating, it is suggested that belts be checked and re-adjusted if necessary. Recheck belts several times in the first days of operation and at least twice a month for the following six months. Thereafter, belts should be checked at each greasing. The drive used on this unit is equipped with banded belts and matching sheaves which transmit much higher horsepower per belt than older type belts. Because much higher tension is required, it is advisable that the tension be checked with a tester or springs scale (see Figure 14). To adjust belts, loosen bolts on motor mounting plate, adjust tension screws on adjustment bracket in or out (depending on desired adjustment), then re-tighten bolts on motor mounting plate. Do not over tighten. Too much or too little tension will damage the drive belts and bearings. Check the tension frequently to be sure the deflection is at the value determined. To replace worn belts, loosen bolts on motor mounting plate and remove tension screws so the old belts can be removed from the sheaves. Remove the tension bracket and the bolts from the upper bearing bracket. Rotate the bracket 90° and remove old belt. Put new belt on and reverse the disassembly order to re-assemble. Replacement belts should be ordered and installed in complete matched sets or one banded belt. Include old belt number(s) when reordering. General Rules of Tensioning 1. Ideal tension is the lowest tension at which the belt will not slip under peak conditions. 2. Check tension frequently during the first 24-48 hours of operation. 3. Over-tensioning shortens belt and bearing life. 4. Keep belts free from foreign material which may cause slippage. 5. Make V-belt inspections on a regular basis. Re-tension when slipping. Never apply belt dressing as this will damage the belt and cause early failure.Model Nominal Belt Span Deflection Force - lbs Deflection New Belt Used Belt C3620 21 3/8 9.1 7.1 11/32 C3625 21 3/8 13.2 8.8 11/32 C2630 21 3/8 13.2 8.8 11/32 C4440 21 3/8 20.1 13.7 11/32 C4450 21 3/8 20.1 13.7 11/3223 High Efficiency Cyclone Dust Collector    C Series EXAMPLE Figure 14.

{"id": "sect7a.pdf::chunk_0", "source": "sect7a.pdf", "text": "Introduction to Cyclones What is a Cyclone? A cyclone is a device that uses centrifugal forces to classify solid particles, in a liquid stream, by size and/or density. What does a Cyclone do? If a cyclone is fed with a sand and water mixture contai ning a range of particle sizes, most of the fine sand will report to the overflow (the top of the cyclone), toge ther with most of the water. Most of the coarse sand will report to the underflow (the bottom of the cyclone), with a less er part of the water. This Size Classification  is most often seen in milling, where the process requires a product of a certain particle size. A grinding mill needs a classifier to ex tract the particles that have been milled sufficiently finely, and to send oversize particles back to the mill for further grinding. A cyclone does this, with the cyclone overflow being the mill final product, and the underflow reporting back to the mill feed. This arrangement is known as closed circuit milling. Typical Sizing Applications : Milling. Location:  Gold, Platinum, Base metals, Chrome, Minerals processing plants. Typical Sizing Applications : Splitting coarse and fine stream s ahead of flotation plants. Location:  Platinum, Base metals, Minerals processing plants. Typical Sizing Applications : Splitting reclaimed sands. Location:  Gold, Minerals processing plants. A cyclone always operates with a size classification  mechanism, but depending on the way a cyclone is used, it can be named differently: Dewatering Cyclone :  If the feed is fairly coarse, the cyclone will split almost all of the water, with very little solids to the overflow. Almost all of the solids will report to the underflow, at a higher pulp density than the feed. Here, the cyclone underflow is the re quired product, and underflow density is the critical factor. Typical Dewatering Applications : Ahead of a dewatering screen. Ahead of tailings thickener, to reduce the load on the thickener. Location:   Gold, Platinum, Coal, Base metals, Chrome, Minerals processing plants. Typical Dewatering Applications : Dewatering dredger stream Location:    Water dam dredging, Sand mining by dredging. Slimes Dam Building :  This is a variant of the dewatering cycl one, where the underflow is used to build the tailings dam wall. Again, the cyclone underflow is  the required product, and the client usually wants the maximum tonnage split to the underflow. Typical Applications : Building tailings dams, Reinforcing dam walls. Location:  Gold, Platinum, Base metals , Chrome, Minerals tailings. Intro Cyclones And Separators.Doc Page  2   Copyright:  Weir Minerals 2011 Desliming Cyclone :  The feed is fairly coarse, with some unwanted fines. The cyclone extracts the fines to the overflow. Again, the cyclone underflow is th e required product, and the client usually wants the minimum amount of fines in the underflow. Typical Applications :  Ahead of spiral plants, Ahead of a jig. Location:  Base metals, Chrome, Minerals processing plants. Degritting Cyclone : The feed is fine slimes (or almost clear wa ter) with a low content of coarse grit. The cyclone extracts the grit to the underflow. The cyclone overflow is the required product. Typical Applications : Ahead of a thickener to prevent sanding out. Location:  Gold, Base metals, Minerals processing plants. Typical Applications :  Degritting water. Location:  Water treatment plant, Water storag e dams, Shaft settling dams, Foundry quench. What are the Advantages of a Cyclone? • No moving parts – so low maintenance, • High capacity - a 600mm cyclone can handle up to 200t/h of solids, • Low capital cost, • Low operating cost, • Rugged, simple to install and operate.

Cut Efficiency Degritting Settling Pond Capital Cost Operating Cost. None Intro Cyclones And Separators.Doc Page  3   Copyright:  Weir Minerals 2011 How Does a Cyclone Work? The pulp stream enters the cyclone at a pressure between 40kPa and 300kPa (for small cyclones), 150kPa for larger cyclones, pumped or gravity fed. The Feed Box  has a tangential or involute en try which causes the feed stream to swirl around the inside of the cyclone, setting up a “whirlpool” flow pattern, w ith an air core (or vortex) running up the centre. Most of the water in the feed exits via the overflow outle t at the top, dragging finer particles with it. The Vortex Finder  prevents the feed stream short-ci rcuiting directly to the overflow. The swirling action subjects the particles in the feed to centrifugal forces. Larger or heavier particles are flung outwards where they meet the sidewall of the cy clone, and are slowed down. This causes them to spiral down the Cone Frustum(s)  of the cyclone and exit out the Spigot . The spigot is subject to high wear, which is why it is a small, easily replaceable item."}

The Vortex Finder prevents the feed stream short-ci rcuiting directly to the overflow. The swirling action subjects the particles in the feed to centrifugal forces. Larger or heavier particles are flung outwards where they meet the sidewall of the cy clone, and are slowed down. This causes them to spiral down the Cone Frustum(s) of the cyclone and exit out the Spigot . The spigot is subject to high wear, which is why it is a small, easily replaceable item. Some of the water in the feed also slows down due to contact with the sidewalls, and reports to the underflow. This water drags a portion of the feed with it, bypassing the classifying action of the “whirlpool” and causing some inefficiency in the cyclone’s operation. About the Cutpoint The mechanism described above is not precise - as opposed to, say, a screen where the majority of particles smaller than the screen aperture pass through, and larger particles are retained. With a screen the cutpoint is very obvious - if the screen has an aperture of 1mm, then its coarse product will be mostly +1mm, and its fine product all -1mm. Particles in a cyclone are subjected to differing cen trifugal forces, and have a shorter or longer path outwards to the sidewall, depending on where they are in  the feed, ie particles ente ring near the outside of the cyclone have a greater chance of eventually report ing to the underflow. Also, there is a “crowding” effect, where particles interfere with others, preven ting them reporting to their intended destination. Due to these factors, all particles in a cyclone have a possibility of reporting to either the overflow or underflow. Obviously, a very large particle has a very  small possibility of reporting to the overflow, but it does have a possibility, even if it is very low. Since the feed stream contains millions of individual particles, if there is a possibility of a million to one, then one particle in a million (of that size) will “go the wrong way”. By varying certain parameters (described later) we can vary how much fines report to the overflow. So we need some measure to describe a cyclone’s performance. We cannot use the simple cutpoint as used to desc ribe a screen because the range of probabilities means that to get a cyclone overflow with 100% minus say, 200 microns we must cut much finer than this. It has been agreed that the best way to describe a cyclone’s cut point is the d50. This is the size of particle which has a 50:50 prob ability of reporting to either  the underflow or overflow. Please note that the d50 cutpoint only describes the cyclone. It has nothing to do with the size grading of the cyclone’s overflow or underflow streams (80% mi nus 75 microns etc.). Those gradings are dependent on the size distribution of the feed to the cyclone, and are commonly described as p80, p50, p20 etc. Intro Cyclones And Separators.Doc Page  4   Copyright:  Weir Minerals 2011 The Effect of the Spigot on a Cyclone’s Operation It is a common misconception that the spigot affects a cyclone’s cutpoint. This is not so. The spigot size will not affect the d50 of the cycl one, or the size grading of the cyclone overflow. What the spigot size does affect is the amount of  water in the cyclone unde rflow. A smaller spigot restricts the underflow, and prevents too much water l eaving. A larger spigot allows more water through. Also as mentioned previously, a cyclone’s flow pattern has an air core, or vortex running up the centre from the spigot up to the vortex finder. The spigot must be small enough to allow the underf low solids to exit with minimal water, but big enough to allow the air core to operate. This sounds tricky , but is easy to check because of the “flare” angle of the underflow from the spigot. When a cyclone is operating normally, with a stable air core, the underflow discharges from the spigot as a hollow cone. The inside angle of the cone - the flare angle - varies with the spigot size. If smaller and smaller spigots are used the angle d ecreases, and the underflow gets denser (less water). This will continue until a point is reached where ther e is not enough room for the air core, and the cone collapses. The underflow then comes out in a solid stream - called “roping”. This is not good, as the cyclone needs the air core for efficient operation. When roping occurs, the spigot is choking, ie discharging its maximum amount of solids, and any coarse solids that cannot get out of the spigot are therefore forced in the wrong direction, out the cyclone overflow. Conversely, if the spigot is cut b ack larger and larger, the flare an gle will increase, and the underflow density will decrease - more water. This also is unde sirable, as the greater the water that is contained in the underflow, the more bypassing of fines is occurring in the cyclone (see page 4 above). The optimum flare angle is 30 to 40 degrees."}

Higher tonnages need a larger spigot. Cyclone Parts Which Affect the d50 Cutpoint The cutpoint of a cyclone can be altered by changing the diameter of the Vortex Finder, or the size of the feed opening, or by adding an Extended Feed Box. A larger Vortex Finder gives an easier path to the overflow, and so coarsens the cutpoint. A smaller Vortex Finder gives a finer cutpoint. The vortex finder diameter is altered by changing the vortex finder. A smaller inlet opening causes higher entry velocity, more centrifugal force, and so gives a finer cutpoint. The inlet size is made smaller by replacing the Inle t Wedge (where fitted) with  a larger wedge, or by changing the cyclone feed box. An Extended Feed Box gives a longer residence time in the cyclone, and so gives more time for the solids to be collected, hence a finer cutpoint. Intro Cyclones And Separators.Doc Page  5   Copyright:  Weir Minerals 2011 Process Factors Which Affect the d50 Cutpoint Higher feed pressure (speeding up the pump) causes higher centrifugal forces, and gives a finer cutpoint. More dilution of the feed causes less crowding, and gives a finer cutpoint. Higher feed density (% solids) gives more crowding and a coarser cutpoint Heavier minerals are more effected by centrifugal forc e than lighter ones. So the same cyclone will have a finer cutpoint on chrome minerals (SG 4) than it will on silica sand (SG 2.6) or coal (SG 1.5). Denser feed liquid (eg brine) will give a coarser cutpoint. Pulp viscosity also affects the cyclone d50. A pulp  with a high proportion of ultrafines or clays (eg kimberlite) will give a coarser cutpoint. Installing a cyclone on its side will give a coarser cu tpoint, as it becomes easier for fines to get out of the overflow. Cyclone Feed Pressure Range Most cyclones operate in the 50kPa to 100kPa feed pressure range. Below a certain feed pressure, the flow patterns in a cyclone become unstable, and the air core will tend to collapse. We recommend a minimum feed pressure of 35 kPa for a cyclone mounted vertically, and 45 kPa for a cyclone mounted on its side. Wear increases dramatically as feed pressure increases. We recommend a maximum feed pressure of 125kPa for fine feed, and a maximum of 100kPa for coarse feed, to prevent excessive wear. But for fine particles or dilute feeds, the maximum pressure can be as high as 300kPa for the smaller cyclones – 400mmØ and less. Recommended maximum feed pressures are – Cyclone Diameter Maximum Feed Pressure (kPa) Up to 400mm 300 400mm to 600mm 200 Larger than 600mm 150 Installation of a Cyclone The cyclone overflow should discharge to atmosphere as soon as possible after the cyclone. If this is not possible due to plant layout restrain ts, then a breather pipe  should be fitted immediately after the overflow bend, to prevent any possibility of siphoning. The cyclone underflow should discharge freely (not submerged), and the spigot flare should be readily visible. All cyclones should have a pressure gauge and protector fitted to the feed  inlet, to allow basic diagnostics on the cyclone operation. Intro Cyclones And Separators.Doc Page  6   Copyright:  Weir Minerals 2011 Causes of Problems in Cyclone Operation A smooth inner surface of the cyclone is critical to en sure undisrupted flow patterns. The following can cause problems: • Loose or torn linings can pulsate or flap. • Parts that have been rubber  lined by another party often have protruding joints. • Home-made or pirated cone sections are often incorrect, giving a step-in at the cone joint A cyclone can handle a range of feed flowrates, but does need a fairly steady feed. The following can cause feed fluctuations, and problems with the cyclone operation: • Loose linings in the feed pipe to the cyclone. • Loose lining, or air leaks in the suction pipe to the cyclone feed pump • Badly worn pump packing can suck air • Poor level control of the feed sump can cause th e feed pump to suck air (snore) which can badly affect the cyclone (and damage the pump liners). • A pipe discharging into the feed sump from a height w ill entrain air. If this is near to the suction, the pump will pull in the air, causing similar problems to a pump snoring. Maintenance Component Replacement The only maintenance operation on a cyclone is the replacement of a component with another when the Linatex lining has worn through.

Maintenance Component Replacement The only maintenance operation on a cyclone is the replacement of a component with another when the Linatex lining has worn through. All components of a cyclone can be purchased as spares from Linatex Australia. All mild steel/Linatex lined components of a Linaex cyclone can be re-lined by local Linatex applicators, providing the component has been replaced before the steel shell has worn through. To prevent wear through requires regular internal inspection. Routine Inspection Frequency The frequency of internal inspection of a cyclone varies with the wear rate experienced in the duty. The wear rate in a duty depends on many factors of the feed, including – • Mineral Characteristics – hard ore means higher wear, • Particle Size – large par ticles give higher wear, • Particle Shape and Sharpness – flat, sharp particles mean higher wear, • Feed Pressure – higher pressure causes higher wear (square law), • Feed slurry % solids – high % solids means higher wear. Linatex recommend internal inspec tions every two months, until a good measure of the cyclone wear rate can be established. Intro Cyclones And Separators.Doc Page  7   Copyright:  Weir Minerals 2011 Component Wear Life As mentioned previously, the wear rate in a cyclon e varies at different locations within the unit. Experience has shown that the ratio of wear life of the components is approximately:- Component  Life Ratio Overflow Box 18 Feed Box 12 Vortex Finder 12 Upper Cone 15 Lower Cone 9 Spigot 4 Discharge Regulator (Fishtail) 6 ie if the spigot lasts four months, the feed box is lik ely to last ±12 months. Whilst this is not exact, and cannot be guaranteed, it is a good general guideline.

A Separator (also known as a fishtail cyclone) is a modified standard cyclone, designed for certain duties. 2.0 Where Would a Separator Offer Advantages? • Dewatering and stockpiling duties where a high  underflow density is required, • As feed densifier ahead of a Screen, A ttrition Cell or Classifier, where a constant  underflow density is required. 3.0 How Does a Cyclone Work? Please refer to the Linatex document “Introduction to Cyclones” for more detail on cyclone operation. The pulp stream enters the cyclone at a pressure between 40kPa and 100kPa (pumped or gravity fed). The Feed Box  has a tangential entry which causes the feed stream to swirl around the inside of the cyclone, setting up a “whirlpool” flow pattern, with an air core (or vortex) running up the centre. Intro Cyclones And Separators.Doc Page  8   Copyright:  Weir Minerals 2011 Most of the water in the feed exits via the overflow at the top of the cyclone, dragging finer particles with it. The Vortex Finder  prevents the feed stream short-ci rcuiting directly to the overflow. The swirling action subjects the particles in the feed to centrifugal forces. Larger and/or heavier particles are flung outwards where they meet the sidewall of the cyclone, and are slowed down. This causes them to spiral down the Cone Frustum(s)  of the cyclone and exit out the Spigot  at the bottom of the cyclone. The spigot is subject to high wear, which is why it is a small, easily replaceable item. Some of the water in the feed also slows down due to contact with the sidewalls, and reports to the underflow. This water drags a portion of the feed with it, bypassing the classifying action of the “whirlpool” and causing some inefficiency in the cyclone’s operation. 4.0 How Does a Separator Work? A Separator has the same components as a standard cy clone, and the principles of operation are similar, with the same internal flow patterns. But a Separator has - • A rubber “fishtail” (underflow discha rge regulator) fitted to the underflow, • An oversize spigot, compared with a st andard cyclone doing the same job, • The overflow pipe deliberately extended to appr oximately two metres below the spigot, to induce a partial vacuum inside the cyclone. • A small air bleed valve on top of the Separator or on the overflow siphon pipe. Simply put, the vacuum sucks the fishtail closed. This holds the underflow back inside the cyclone until the weight of the solids is enough to open the fishta il and discharge. If there are no solids in the feed, nothing discharges from the underflow. The air bleed valve on the Separator or on the overflow pipe allows fine-tuning of the underflow density. Less air = more vacuum = denser underflow, with less water and fines. More air = less vacuum = wetter underflow, with more water and fines in the underf low. Maximum vacuum should be approximately minus 35kPa. Intro Cyclones And Separators.Doc Page  9   Copyright:  Weir Minerals 2011 5.0 What are the Advantages of a Sepa rator Compared With a Cyclone?

Intro Cyclones And Separators.Doc Page 9 Copyright: Weir Minerals 2011 5.0 What are the Advantages of a Sepa rator Compared With a Cyclone? Advantage Standard Cyclone Separator Higher Underflow Density Max of 50%-52% solids vol/vol. A thick mud that flows. Max of 58% solids vol/vol. Wet sand that stacks up. Less Fines in Underflow Cyclone short-circuiting is proportional to U/F water content. Separator U/F has lower water content, so less short-circuiting. Constant Underflow Density Unde rflow density varies if feed % solids changes. Underflow density is independent of the feed density. No Flooding When solids feed is interrupted, underflow floods with water. When solids feed is interrupted, the underflow solids stops. Easy to Adjust Underflow Density Must change the spigot to change the U/F density. Simply adjust the vacuum bleed valve to adjust the U/F density. Less Spigot Blockage Small spigots can block with gravel, bolts etc. Uses a larger spigot, so less prone to spigot blockages. Less Spigot Wear Spigot is a high wear item. Spigot lasts up to 10x longer. 6.0 What are the Disadvantages of a Separator? • Cutpoint:   The d50 cutpoint of a Separator is coarser than a standard cyclone by approximately 10%. • Feed Pressure Range:   Standard cyclones will operate with a minimum feed pressure as low as 30kPa, and a maximum up to 300kPa. A Separator needs a minimum feed pressure of 40kPa, and above 120kPa the underflow density will decreas e (water gets “blown” out of the fishtail). • Height Requirements:   The overflow siphon leg needs an extra two metres of headroom, compared with a standard cyclone. • Steady Feed:   A Separator is more sensitive to fluctuating feed volume/pressure than a standard cyclone. • Feed Density:   Separator feed density must be below 12% solids by volume (equal to 25% solids by weight for silica sand), to make sure there is enough water in the overflow to create the required vacuum.

Introduction The Directorate General of Shipping (DGS), which is the Indian Maritime Authority (IMA) is an attached office of the the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways (MoPSW), Govt. of India and deals with all executive matters, relating to merchant shipping. Maritime transport is a critical infrastructure for the social and economic development of a country. It influences the pace, structure, and pattern of development. The Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways encompasses within its fold Ports, Shipping and Waterways sectors which include Shipbuilding and Ship-repair, Major Ports, National Waterways, and Inland Water Transport. The Directorate General of Shipping, India deals with implementation of shipping policy and legislation so as to ensure the safety of life and ships at sea, prevention of marine pollution, promotion of maritime education and training in co-ordination with the International Maritime Organization (IMO), regulation of employment and welfare of seamen, development of coastal shipping, augmentation of shipping tonnage, examination and certification of Merchant Navy Officers, Supervision and Control of the allied offices under its administrative jurisdiction. Following are the objectives of the Directorate General of Shipping: • Matters affecting Merchant Shipping & navigation and administration of the Merchant Shipping Law, • Measures to ensure safety of life and ships at sea, • Development of Indian Shipping, • International Conventions relating to Maritime matters, • Provision of facilities for training of Officers and ratings for Merchant Navy, • Regulation of Employment of Seamen and their welfare, • Regulatory aspect of Sailing Vessel. 2. Legal Mandate Section 37 of the Disaster Management Act 2005, requires every Ministry and Department of the Government of India, be it hazard-specific nodal ministries or not, shall prepare comprehensive Disaster Management Plan detailing how each of them will contribute to the national efforts in the domains of disaster prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery. ‘Under National Disaster Management Plan - 2019’ certain Ministries have been Page 4 of 25  assigned primary role to deal with different types of Disasters. The nodal Ministry assigned to deal with Cyclone / Storm is the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES). As a proactive measure the Directorate General of Shipping (DGS) has prepared this Plan to augment efforts of the Ministries and Departments which are dealing with Disasters such as Cyclones and Storms. 3. Disasters as per NDMP – 2019 applicable to the DGS The ‘National Disaster Management Plan – 2019’ (NDMP – 2019) issued by National Disaster Management Authority, Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India, lists the five major categories of disasters, which further has different ‘hazards or disasters’ listed under each of those five major categories. From section 1.13.1 of NDMP – 2019, which lists the five major disasters, it is seen that the disasters namely ‘Cyclone / Wind / Storm’ which are placed under major disaster category of ‘Meteorological Disasters’ would be relevant to this Directorate. Further, it may be noted that section 1.14.1 of NDMP – 2019, designates Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) as the nodal Ministry for the disaster category of ‘Meteorological Disasters’ and remains responsible for all the disasters listed under this major disaster category. However, since this Directorate along with the Indian Coast Guard plays a role towards regulating safety of life at sea, protection of environment and property at sea, hence as a proactive measure it has prepared a Disaster Management Plan, which aim is to address the risks associated with Cyclone, Strom & Wind. This plan will augment the efforts of the nodal Ministry in this regard. 4. International Obligation pertaining to Meteorological Services and Warnings  The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), Chapter V (Safety of Navigation), as amended, Regulation 5 (Meteorological services and warnings), obligates states to provide necessary meteorological warnings and forecasts in the specified area."}

International Obligation pertaining to Meteorological Services and Warnings The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), Chapter V (Safety of Navigation), as amended, Regulation 5 (Meteorological services and warnings), obligates states to provide necessary meteorological warnings and forecasts in the specified area. Further, members of World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) are obligated to implement Marine Meteorological Services (MMS) in their specified region to ensure international coordination of meteorological services. Meteorological forecasts and warnings are issued as part of Page 5 of 25  Maritime Safety Information (MSI) under the auspices of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and WMO as World-Wide Met-ocean Information and Warnings Service (WWMIWS) under the Global Maritime Distress and Safety Systems (GMDSS). All meteorological forecasts and warnings are issued as part of Maritime Safety Information (MSI). Maritime Safety Information (MSI) are issued in accordance with IMO resolution A.705(17), while all meteorological warnings and forecasts (which are part of MSI) are issued in accordance with the requirements of IMO resolution A.1051(27), section 3.4.1 which requires that ‘all Meteorological information’ shall be broadcast only in English by International NAVTEX and Safety NET services. SOLAS, Chapter V, Regulation 5, requires that contracting governments have systems in place to warn ships of gales, storms and tropical cyclones by the issue of information in text and, as far as practicable in graphic form, using the appropriate shore-based facilities for terrestrial and space radiocommunications services. These warnings are to be issued at least twice a day and frequency may be increased in case of storm or cyclone. Further, it is required that forecasts, warnings, synoptic and other meteorological data intended for ships shall be issued and disseminated by the ‘national meteorological service’ which can serve both the coastal and high sea areas, in accordance with mutual arrangements made by the state with the World Meteorological Organization pertaining to the system, for the preparation and dissemination of meteorological forecasts and warnings for the high seas and coastal areas under the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS). India Meteorological Department (IMD) is the designated ‘national meteorological service’ for India and caters to India’s international commitments in terms of weather warning forecasting and dissemination of same to all ships and vessels in the coastal and high seas. IMD is the department of ‘Ministry of Earth Science’ which is the designated nodal Ministry for Meteorological disasters as listed in ‘National Disaster Management Plan – 2019. 5. Scope of this plan in dealing with Disaster (Cyclones / Storms) This document is prepared keeping DGS in the coordinating role with other government agencies and other stakeholders, such as Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), Oil and Natural gas Corporation (ONGC), Indian Coast Page 6 of 25  Guard (ICG), Indian navy (IN), Port Authorities, Shipowners and Shipowners Associations (INSA, ICCSA), etc. while dealing with disasters such as Cyclones and Storms. The aim is to augment efforts of all other Authorities and Government Departments in this regard. Role of DGS primarily pertains to coordinating the weather warnings dissemination by the nodal agencies and receipt of same by various stakeholders such as ship owners, charterers, etc. If necessary, DGS may provide advise and instructions under the circumstances, to the ships, the advise or instructions given are to be considered by the ship Master and/or Owners and/or Charters when taking decisions for safety of life, environment, and property at sea. In addition, DGS would play a role in sorting out any issue in this regard, which is brought to its notice, by coordinating between stakeholders and the relevant authorities such as Port Authority, Directorate General of Hydrocarbons, Indian Coast Guard, etc. 6. Receipt of weather warning i.e Cyclone or Storm ‘DG Comm Centre’ is manned 24x7 to cater to India’s obligations under SOLAS, Chapter XI-2 and the International Ship & Port Facility Security Code (ISPS Code). In addition, to the aforesaid functions, DG Comm Centre also act as the first point of contact in case of any marine casualty and/or act as the coordinating office in case of a Disaster such as Cyclone / Storm / Wind (as per the National Disaster Management Plan – 2019). This Plan outlines action taken by the DG Comm Center upon receipt of Cyclone warning from the IMD. Page 7 of 25  7. Flow Chart of actions in case of Cyclone / Storm Figure 1 – Work Flow Chart Page 8 of 25  8. Action of D.G Comm Centre and/or L.R.I.T in case of Cyclone warning: 8.1 Receipt of initial warning from IMD (by email). This warning may be that of a ‘depression’ which is likely to develop into a Cyclone on a given date and time. 8.2 Inform N.A and N.S (Casualty & Response) by phone. 8.3 Upon receipt of such warning from IMD, forward same to Indian shipping companies, Charterers (approved by the DGS), and Indian ship-owners association such as ICCSA, INSA.
